I"ù<p>Here in the DMV, Dempsey Hamilton owns and operates <a href="https://www.mobiusrecordshop.com/">Mobius Records</a> in Fairfax VA. Opening in 2014, Hamilton operated his store in a small building across from the stores current location. In 2016, he moved to a much larger space due to demand. Hamilton describes his record sales as Ã’sustainableÃ“ but noticed a significant increase in sales in the past few years.</p>

<p>Hamiltonâ€™s observations line up with <a href="https://www.riaa.com/reports/2021-mid-year-music-industry-revenue-report-riaa/">RIAA data</a>. Record sales jumped 216.6% between 2014 and 2020. In 2014, at the time of opening, vinyl sales were at 10.32 million. Last year, 22.36 million records were sold.</p>

<p>According to RIAA data, the estimated value of vinyl in 2020 was around $12.2 billion. This is nearly double the value of records from the beginning of the decade to now. In addition, a 2018 poll of people 18-65 found that around 9% of people in the US listen to vinyl records. With COVID Lockdowns preventing people from visiting stores and streaming services dominating music consumption in the late 2010â€™s, how are vinyl records maintaining relevance?</p>

<div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8058976/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/8058976" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;" /> </a></div>

<p>Long before the internet, vinyl records were the primary source of music consumption. According to the RIAA sales database, vinyl sales hit their peak in 1978, selling over 49.3 million records that year. In the 90s, the CD was introduced leading to a major decline in vinyl sales</p>

<p>Despite this jump in sales/demand, record stores like Hamiltonâ€™s are struggling with receiving records at a timely manner. Ã’It is a constant battle every week to get new releases in and getting certain titles from certain labels. But yes, weâ€™re seeing a bottleneck in both distribution and manufacturing of records.Ã“</p>

<p>Part of the reason for this delay is the rising cost of PVC. PVC <a href="https://www.chemorbis.com/en/pvc/polyvinyl-chloride-pvc-plastics-news-prices-analysis">is the primary resource needed to manufacture a vinyl record.</a>  This material has been relatively high in price for years, and record plants cannot afford to buy the amount needed to produce at full capacity.</p>

<p><em>Why are vinyl record sales so high?</em></p>

<p>According to Hamilton, Mobius records operated on a Ã’hybridÃ“ model. Ã’During the lockdown, we moved our inventory online, created a website. We had a presence on discogsÃ‰ and now our business is 50% online, and 50% in person.Ã“</p>

<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/about">Discogs</a> is a Ã’a user-built database of music.Ã“ Essentially, theyâ€™re a website where people log the records they own and discogs keeps track of the different artists and their releases. According to their website, the discogs database had over 7 million artists and 14 million recordings in it. Another feature with discogs is their marketplace.</p>

<p>The marketplace is a part of the database where people can list records to sell through the database and buyers can purchase them. This marketplace is where Mobius records sold their records during the lockdown. Anyone who owns vinyl can list records to sell on discogs. This marketplace has been a key to keeping vinyl record popularity. Since fans can find obscure records on Discogs without having to go record store hunting, it allows fans of artists to find records faster. In addition, it allows record stores like Mobius to operate online without having to create an entire online store.</p>

<p>In Adams Morgan, <a href="http://smash.dead-city.org/wordpress/about">Smash Records</a> has been owned and operated by Bobby Poloski. Originally from Georgetown, this store operated there from 1984 until 2006. In Bobbyâ€™s view, the decline of the cd led to an increase in record sales. Ã’Vinylâ€™s became the bulk of what we sellÃ‰surprisingly the drop in cd sales coincided with the rise of record sales.Ã“</p>

<p>The numbers match his conclusions. In the 2000s, CD sales plummeted from 93.4% of totals sales in 2002 to just 16.2% of total sales in 2010.</p>

<p>With the rise of streaming services like Spotify and apple music, vinyl was starting to see the end. However, many factors have led to the rise in vinyl sales in the past decade. Whether itâ€™s easier access to purchasing records, or the decline of cd, vinylâ€™s are here to stay.</p>
