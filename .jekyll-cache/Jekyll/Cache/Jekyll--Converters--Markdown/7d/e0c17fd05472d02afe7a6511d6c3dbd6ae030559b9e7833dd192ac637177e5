With an increase of 96% adoption rate for dogs, and 103% for cats, according to a report by Shelter Animals Count published on November of 2020.

<p>Pet adoptions have always been an option for anyone who is willing to acquire a pet as company, with the many options possible, over the past year there has been a trend for preference of adopting cats as their first option, and dogs as their second option. According to Forbes and The Washington Post, this has all started between the Millenials and Generation Z, in this generation there has been the presence of pets during their childhoods most specifically dogs, years later when this generations have the means to be able to care for a pet they have chosen to adopt cats. ‚ÄúI like adopting cats because of their independence, in my case my cat is a special needs cat which requires more time consumed towards her, but I consider that cats are a better option than dogs, dogs are too dependent and as a student I don‚Äôt think this is viable‚Äù said Taylor Whittington, a student at American University.  Cats are proven to be more independent than compared to dogs, this has presented an interest in Gen Z and Milenials because of their lifestyles they cannot fit a pet such like a dog that requires more time invested, with cats being flexible to the lifestyles the owners have this has created a trend seen in the past year where local shelters in the area and nationwide have run out of animals to offer for adoption, this has set a competition for shelters and rescue foundations to acquire more animals to satisfy the adoption demands, this has made costumers fly across the country or drive between states to adopt a cat based on their needs of company when back at home.</p>

<p>The pet industry is currently growing and will continue to grow based on the interest of both adopting or purchasing animals and taking care of their needs. When taking care of their needs there are owners who look for high end products that will guarantee the best health for their pets, this are the factors that push this industry to exponentially grow. When ‚Äúhumanizing‚Äù pets, there are more possibilities inside this industry to create markets that satisfy different types of income that pet owners have, this industry has all the space for creativity within the entrepreneurs that offer services and goods for pets, this is why with the evolving times and technology this industry is predicted to grow to $365.62 billion dollars by the year of 2027.</p>

<p>Looking back at the past year of 2020, there has been a trend studied on the interest on purchasing or adopting pets, but the trend has set for adoption of pets because pet owners are well aware of the implications buying from breeders can do for the owner and the animal itself. Irresponsible breeding or backyard breeding‚Äôs has existed since the beginning, this has created a response from Gen Z and Millennial who are influencing the pet industry and the adoption rates, because they chose to acquire an animal going through the moral implications were the animal is not harm in the process. By adopting pets, owners ensure that the pet does not suffer any consequences from breeding that can result in early death of the animal or possible euthanasia, Debra Duel from the Human Rescue Alliance where their mission is to grow families through adoption, protect animals from harm and provide programs where people and pets can stay together,  stated, ‚ÄúPets should be a lifetime investment, not something that will keep you company for a   few year, it is your responsibility to give the animal a long and healthy life, this is why I choose adopting, it is a second chance for animals to live their best lives‚Äù. Over the past years with comparison of last year, there has been a forecast that pet adoptions will continue to increase which will fuel the industry to grow more, and both local and nationwide shelters have their compromise of handling pets to responsible owners or families while also educating them through programs on how to make the most of the adopted animal and continue to create awareness programs on how breeding is animal cruelty and adopting is the best and most suitable option when wanting to acquire company from an animal.</p>
