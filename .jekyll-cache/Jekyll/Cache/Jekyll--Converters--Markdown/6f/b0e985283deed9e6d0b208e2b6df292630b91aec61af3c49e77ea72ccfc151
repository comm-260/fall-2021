I"È<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected more age groups more severely than others. To date there have been 557,486 deaths resulting from the coronavirus. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#ExcessDeaths">Data from the CDC</a> shows that the bulk of deaths were people over the age of 50. It is well established that COVID-19 has a greater effect on the elderly than it does on the young. However, this is not to say that younger people are immune from the virus and death. 2020 saw an 8.7% increase in deaths from 2019 in people under the age of 25. 2020 also saw a 3.5% rise in deaths of people under the age of 25 when compared to the yearly average between 2016-2019.</p>
