I"î<p>When the Grammys announced the nominees on November 23, many in the music industry raised their eyebrows to see Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff among those nominated for album of the year: not just for their album â€œEvermoreâ€, but also for co-writing Olivia Rodrigoâ€™s â€œSour.â€ Considering that neither Swift nor Antonoff or Annie Clark (whoâ€™s collaborated with Swift in the past and is also nominated for â€œSourâ€) actively wrote any Rodrigoâ€™s â€œSourâ€, many were perplexed by the Academyâ€™s nod to Swift and her collaborators. On Sunday night the Recording Academy, the entity responsible for the Grammy awards, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/taylor-swift-olivia-rodrigo-grammy-2022-nomination-adjustment-1235005995/">rectified the mistake</a>, citing a mistake in paperwork. The Recording Academyâ€™s confusion is yet another chapter in a long story about the difference between copyright infringement and paying proper homage to the artistic influences that came before. According to analysis of case data, musical copyright cases have been increasing in frequency over the past decade with significant increases in the past five years, raising increasing complex questions about musical ownership in the 21st century.</p>
