I"Æ<p>For decades Marvel has dominated the superhero cinema industry, so why is it that we rarely see women playing the main character? There are plenty of female superheroes in the comics. Gender is wildly misrepresented in the film and comic industry and Marvel is one of the biggest perpetrators of excluding non-male main characters. Marvel, however, claims that they are trying to change this. In October of 2019 Disney declared Kevin Feige to be the new president of Marvel Studios as well as its Chief Creative Officer. Since this change in leadership Marvel has noticeably been trying to appeal to a larger demographic by being more inclusive of main characters that arenâ€™t necessarily white males.</p>
