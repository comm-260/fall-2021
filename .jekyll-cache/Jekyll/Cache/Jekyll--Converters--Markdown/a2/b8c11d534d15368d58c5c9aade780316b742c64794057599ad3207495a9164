I"(<p>As high-profile mass shootings have increased in frequency over the past twenty-five years, a pattern has emerged in those who carry out these attacks. Most often the attacker is revealed to usually be middle-class, White, and male. Whether it be Stephen Paddock, Adam Lanza, or James Holmes they all share these characteristics. Similarly, in America, suicides are disproportionately carried out by members of the exact same gender, race, and economic backgrounds. Using data compiled by The Violence Project on Mass Shootings as well as the CDC‚Äôs suicide data revealed that half of all mass shooters were White males and that suicides make up for a third of White male deaths. The parallels in statistical groups are not just in gender and race, shootings and suicides are both correlated to be committed in middle-class areas by middle-class perpetrators. This article seeks to show overlapping similarities between incidents, not to make generalized statements about racial groups nor is it to prove a direct connection between identity characteristics and these acts.
Suicide data from the CDC shows an overwhelming majority of suicide victims are male as well as White. These characteristics are similar to those of mass shooters as data from The Violence Project revealed. According to the data provided, ninety-eight percent of mass shooters were male, and over half were White. These statistics alone do not reveal direct causation, just a correlation between White males and these acts. This still leaves a question to be answered, why? White males are statistically the most economically and socially privileged in this country, yet they are one of the most likely to commit acts of self-destruction or mass killing. Part of it certainly has to do with population, Whites make up the largest racial population in the country so there is a certain sense to their statistical dominance. Still, amongst men, Whites make up the greatest percentage of suicides per 100,000 behind Native Americans, Blacks and Asians follow.</p>

<h2 id="correlations-between-suicide-and-mass-shootings">Correlations Between Suicide and Mass Shootings</h2>
<p>Suicide and mass shootings have more than these basic race and gender statistical similarities. Mass Shooters also have a direct connection with suicide as many shooters either kill themselves during the act or had previously been suicidal. The Violence Project revealed that nearly three-quarters of mass shooters fell into either of these two categories. Thirty percent were previously suicidal, and forty percent intended to die during the act. Again, half of these male mass shooters were White showing another correlation between the two acts and racial groups. Another correlation between suicide and mass shootings is the weapon of choice, firearms. Firearms are used in all mass shootings, however, their prevalence as a suicide method is worth mentioning. CDC data shows that White males were seven times more likely than females of any race to commit suicide by firearm. Comparing all suicides to White male suicides within the same age range, also showed that White men killed themselves with firearms double the amount of the national average.
Arielle Geismar is a youth gun violence activist whose work has intersected both mass shootings, and suicide. She has worked as a National Organizing Fellow for Team Enough of the Brady Campaign United Against Gun Violence. I asked her why the profile of mass shooters was so skewed towards White males. ‚ÄúThe profile of the mass shooter typically is a White male. Often, he is ostracized in some form either socially or neglected by his parents. This is strange however because statistically White males are some of the most catered to especially within a school environment.‚Äù Speaking on why White men commit suicide at a disproportionate rate she had this to say. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak to the exact reason it‚Äôs disproportionate, but I do know that most Veteran and White rural male suicides are gun suicides. This may contribute to why White males commit suicide more than other groups.‚Äù Finally, I asked her why in her opinion both issues were overly prevalent for White men. ‚ÄúI think it has to do with White male, and maybe just male temperament in this country. Men are not taught ways to reach out for emotional help, but what they are given is ample and easy access to guns. It‚Äôs terrible, but it makes some sense as to why men unequally end up turning weapons against themselves or others.‚Äù</p>
