I"¬<p>Imagine you head into the store, going straight to the womenâ€™s section to buy a new pair of dress pants for your upcoming job interview. Youâ€™re in desperate need of high-quality, professional slacks, but canâ€™t afford to spend an unlimited amount. The cheapest pair you can find is $119. You reason with yourself that theyâ€™re worth the cost and head to the register to check out. As your cashier says, â€œThatâ€™ll be $119,â€ the person next to you, buying the same pair of dress pants, yet from the menâ€™s section, is only being charged $98. You frown and wonder how youâ€™re possibly paying more than them, but sigh and reluctantly slide your card into the machine.</p>
