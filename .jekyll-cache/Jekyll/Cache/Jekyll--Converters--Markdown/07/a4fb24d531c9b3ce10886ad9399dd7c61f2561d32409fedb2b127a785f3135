I"¹<p>Boston Latin Academy, one of the three exam schools in the Boston Public Schools district, stands as a monument to dedicated teachers as well as glaring neglect. The schoolsâ€™ teachers are regarded as having great dedication for their students, some teachers have held their positions for over ten years, some even longer. BLA has a reputation for providing students with exemplary lessons, but a reputation as being lesser than the other two exam schools. Boston Latin School, the main established rival school of BLA is regarded as one of the first high schools in the country, and has maintained a reputation of rigorous education and high standards. Students have stated that their university education has been easier than their BLS one. Boston Latin School has hosted a variety of notable alumni, who are able to contribute to its reputation, BLA and the John D. Oâ€™Bryant School has less of a reputation but has its own accomplishments.</p>
