I"9<p>She sat in her room, and watched the pile of books grow larger, week after week of remaining stuck in the house. Reading was everything, it was her way of maintaining a routine and keeping sane amidst unprecedented times.</p>

<p>Ryan Murphy, 20, a junior attending The College of New Jersey, has always considered herself an avid reader, and staying in her house in her small town of Harrington Park during the spring of 2020 and the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, she found immense comfort in one of her oldest interestsÑlosing herself in a book.</p>

<p>“Obviously quarantine was an incredibly difficult and stressful time for most people,” Murphy said, nodding to her friend casually sitting beside her. “I found myself reading frequently as a way to manage everything going on in the world and keep things from feeling too overwhelming.”</p>

<p>Like many others, Ryan Murphy supplemented her reading with Goodreads, the worldÕs largest site for readers and book recommendations, according to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/about/us">Goodreads</a>. Goodreads allows its users to review, rate, and recommend books, all while connecting with their peers. The rating feature is what is most attractive to users, according to Murphy, as they can rate books from one to five. Along with that, they can write their own review, and then view and comment on other users reviews as well.</p>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically during the height of quarantine in March and April, Goodreads users had a hugely positive spike, gaining around 105,000 users in April 2020 alone, according to data from a sample of Goodreads users put into a Global Book Reading Dataset.</p>

<p>The rating feature is what is most attractive to users, according to Murphy, as they have the opportunity to rate books from one to five. Along with that, they can write their own review, and then view and comment on other users reviews as well.</p>

<p>“Rating books is the best part of Goodreads,” Murphy exclaimed. She pulled up her Goodreads and scrolled though, showing off the numerous books she has rated, ranging across multiple different genres. “ItÕs a huge motivator to finish a book, especially since I know that I can see what people say and they can see what I write.”</p>

<p>Books like the Harry Potter series, The Hunger Games, and Twilight, have amassed some of the most user reviews, with all of them obtaining around 40,000 reviews, according to a dataset of Goodreads user rating data.</p>

<p>Goodreads has had a strong presence for years, but more people were attracted to it as the pandemic grew in severity. Sofia Brockman, 20, a student at American University, considered herself a big reader earlier in her life, but as she got older, she found herself gravitating towards other hobbies, therefore reading less and less. She had heard about Goodreads in July of 2021 and found the idea of a social platform for reading very appealing, according to Brockman.</p>

<p>“I was attracted to the idea of sharing my thoughts and being able to find friends and discuss books with them on this platform,” Brockman said. “ItÕs like a really big book club, and the sense of community is really comforting.”</p>

<p>Brockman excitedly explained the features of Goodreads she enjoyed the most, specifically the reading challenge. The Goodreads yearly reading challenge allows users to create a goal for themselves and participate with their friends. The social aspect of Goodreads allows for users to join groups, ranging from science fiction to Taylor Swift Lyrics that relate to books, according to Brockman.</p>

<p>Like Brockman, Kelli Pastor, 51, from Layton New Jersey, had not heard of Goodreads until relatively recently. She has been reading for most of her life and has been a member of multiple different book clubs, one of which was focused entirely on reading and analyzing War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy.</p>

<p>“I first heard of Goodreads when I went to my local bookstore,” Pastor said. There was a display table featuring “BookTok favorites” and “Goodreads Discussion Starters” and upon seeing she went home and looked up those unfamiliar terms, according to Pastor.</p>

<p>“Social Media and reading were never intertwined in my mind,” Pastor exclaimed. “It is such a foreign concept to me, but I feel that it will be very beneficial in re-engaging readers, especially those of a younger generation.”</p>

<p>With COVID-19, more and more people spent time inside, and like Brockman, they had the free time to discover new interests. There was a rise in social media presence, with TikTok in particularly experiencing massive growth. TikTok appealed to so many different groups of people, as everyone can find a niche to express themselves, according to Brockman.</p>

<p>Imogen Angel, 19, a sophomore at American University, became familiar with Goodreads through TikTok Ñshe created an account after receiving many book recommendations via TikTok.</p>

<p>BookTok, a sect of TikTok, emerged in during COVID, and was an important factor in the growth of Goodreads, according to Angel. “BookTokers,” as the influencers who grew from promoting books, have been called, would use Goodreads to connect with their followers, encouraging them to join the platform.</p>

<p>“I ultimately made the account in order to follow the reviews of the influencers I found on TikTok,Ó Angel exclaimed. ÒThey created groups on Goodreads for their followers to join, and the book recommendations have been amazing.”</p>

<p>For Angel, reading is an important form of expression, like those across the world who joined Goodreads during the pandemic. From February 2020 to September 2020, Goodreads had users join from 229 different countries, spanning each continent, with Antarctica being the exception, according to a dataset of a sample of Goodreads users that joined the site during the pandemic.</p>

<p>In that same period, 48.8 percent of users that joined were female, with 38.7 percent being male and 12.4 percent not identifying within that binary according to that same dataset.</p>

<p>Goodreads reaches and attracts such a large group, according to Angel. The app is an ever-growing community that continues to evolve and grow.</p>

<p>For Murphy, Goodreads provides an excitement that reading has not had for a while.</p>

<p>“There is so much potential for the future of Goodreads,Ó Murphy said. ÒI canÕt wait to keep reading and finding others who share my passion.”</p>
