As the Covid-19 pandemic took over the United States, consuming our lives, so did mental health issues. More specifically, anxiety and depression–two of the most common mental illnesses in the US (<em>National Institute of Mental Health</em>). Studies about these disorders can enlighten us when it comes to the impact that the pandemic has had on mental health. In a study by the <strong>National Center for Health Statistics</strong> symptoms were quantified using a scale, and measured over the course of 7-days by adults all around the United States.</p> <iframe title="Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Throughout 2020 " aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-A4In3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/A4In3/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <h2 id="anxiety-and-depression">Anxiety and Depression</h2> <p>In the US, the month with the <strong>highest percentage of anxiety and depression symptoms</strong> during the year of 2020 was <strong>December.</strong> This aligns with the start of an upward trend in Covid cases and hospitalizations during the month, which led to stricter regulations and an increased lockdown. In fact, as the year went on, mental health fluctuated very much in conjunction with the amount of covid cases. As restrictions began to be lifted in April, there was a sharp decrease in the average number of symptoms, but as cases rose and restrictions did too, there were evident increases.</p> <h2 id="the-collegiate-impact">The collegiate impact</h2> <p>When the pandemic first hit in March of 2020 and students were sent home from schools and universities, isolation began. This was particularly difficult for college students and young adults, <strong>ages 18-29</strong>; students were forcibly removed from their social lives, going back to living in their childhood bedrooms and having limited outside contact. As these challenges faced the country, colleges suddenly had to adapt to a growing number of mental health concerns.</p> <iframe title="Symptoms of Mental Health by Age in 2020" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-nPqVJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nPqVJ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="208"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <p>At <strong>American University</strong> in <strong>Washington DC,</strong> the counseling center became inundated with requests for telehealth appointments, and these requests only increased as the year went on. <strong>Jacqueline Darby, Director of Clinical Services at the AU Counseling Center</strong> acknowledges that this pandemic has brought to light the importance of mental health awareness. “I think COVID-19 has brought to people’s attention the importance of taking care of their mental health,” she says. “COVID-19 was and still is a hard time for everyone and it makes sense that individuals need support in processing all that occurred during 2020.”</p> <p>Given the pandemic, the AU Counseling Center has seen an <strong>increase in counseling appointments,</strong> given partially because this year, more students are able to access the counseling services. “Last year, we were limited by licensure requirements, and we could only see students who were physically located in DC, Maryland or Virginia. Now, with students being back on campus more people can use our services.” This increase in services has been a remarkable help for the AU community, largely encouraging the use of mental health resources.</p> <p>For Renee Gopon, an American University sophomore, she felt that her mental health was definitely impacted by the challenges of online school, especially at the outset of the pandemic in March. “Looking at a screen all day, on top of countless students being at home, affected students’ ability to be enthusiastic about their studies, which for me impacted my grades.” When students are faced with these challenges, it becomes harder to tend to mental health, as Gopon mentions. “There were so many factors that impacted mental health because of the pandemic and I think that the circumstances of quarantine made it difficult for anyone to thrive in an emotional mental capacity.”</p> <h2 id="international-perspective">International Perspective</h2> <p>For international students at American University and beyond, mental health challenges are augmented due to time differences, online classes, and simply the transition of living in a new country. Eric Rafael Torija Mosquera is from Luxembourg, and carried out his Covid-19 quarantine from his home in Europe. “As an international student, there are a lot of mental health challenges,” he says, in regards to the 2020 pandemic. “During my experience online during the lockdown of fall 2020, very little was done to accommodate the needs of internationals.” Mosquera mentioned the late registration times for classes, lack of accommodations for time differences, and difficulty in building a sense of community. “You and your friends all have so much to do, which makes it harder to make meaningful friendships which decrease mental health,” he says, noting the importance of friendship to his own mental health. “My friends get me through any mental health challenge that comes up. If you have a community, you’re surviving.</p> <h2 id="forming-community">Forming Community</h2> <p>But international students are not the only ones who feel that a sense of belonging during tough times can improve mental health. Adam Hussaini, an AU sophomore studying Political Science, remarked that the lack of community has worsened his mental health. “I think more of an on-campus community is vital to feeling a part of something. You need to find your identity as an AU student, and with a stronger community–especially during the pandemic–this would help.</p> <p>With an increase in workload as he moves through sophomore year, Hussaini wonders how the AU community is working to better support the student’s mental health.”Challenge Accepted is trying to have us take on challenges,” he says, “but <strong>how are we supposed to do that when we are already challenged with our mental health and the pandemic?</strong> How are we to take on more challenges when we are set back with mental health problems?”</p> <h2 id="dc-data">DC Data</h2> <p>While American University feels the weight of mental health struggles, so does the DC community at large. In terms of which mental health services were most requested over the past year, community support and therapy stay close to the top of the list. This is unsurprising, given the need for community mental health resources during a pandemic, as well as increased therapy appointments for individuals needing to discuss their unique concerns.</p> <iframe title="January 2021 DC Behavioral Health Report(Oct 1, 2019-Sept 30, 2020)" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-AM8cT" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AM8cT/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="428"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <p>According to DMV native Hope Lockwood, she strongly believes that isolation, specifically back in the heart of the pandemic, is what has led to this need for greater services. “I think a lot of people have felt isolated (during the pandemic) which has caused a deterioration in overall mental health,” she says. Hope is not alone in this belief–when surveyed, AU students overwhelmingly agreed that they have felt the impacts of isolation personally, leading to an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms.</p> <iframe title="Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in the US " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-yPwtb" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yPwtb/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="525"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <p>At the end of the day, the entire US saw the impact of anxiety and depression rates climbing throughout Covid-19. Though the entire US was hit hard, <strong>Louisiana, Nevada, and Mississippi</strong> were hit the hardest specifically by anxiety and depression symptoms. For these states particularly, mental health resources are more than necessary. For every state, though, <strong>a greater awareness of mental health issues is necessary</strong> in order for us to thrive during these challenging times.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/fall-2021/mlm-alticor-lobbying/">&laquo; The World’s Largest MLM has Given Millions to Republicans to Restrict the Rights of Their Sellers</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/fall-2021/green-campus-au/">How green is the grass on the Friedham Quad? &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/fall-2021/images/final_image.jpg" alt="The Pandemic Mental Health Crisis: How the world is healing after a year of struggle"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/goodreads-covid-19/">Good for Goodreads: Reading Grows in Popularity amid COVID-19 Pandemic</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/pandemic-restaurants-dc/">For DC Restaurants, the Pandemic Persists</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/tax-feminine-products/">More Tax and Less Pay</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/fall-2021/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
