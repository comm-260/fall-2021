The district’s mayor, Bowser, acknowledged that the global covid-19 pandemic has heavily affected our towns and cities in ways yet to be fully determined. Therefore, one of the causes of the increased shootings could be the covid-19 pandemic. The United States does not have measures such as the national firearms registry. People in all states, including Washington DC, can lawfully carry firearms openly in public. Therefore, the increased number of shootings can be blamed on the lack of laws to restrict ownership and use of guns. The government seems to prioritize gun ownership over respect for human rights. Andy James, a volunteer for Brady said, “I don’t know much about the number of shootings in D.C., but during my time as a volunteer, I came into contact with many shooting victims. They were either members of the family who died in shootings or experienced shootings. In fact, almost all the victims I have contacted are dissatisfied with the government’s current policies. They hope that the government can do more effective management; this is also the goal Brady has been working on.”Despite the increased circulation of firearms, the government continues to set up regulations that could save many people. According to research, gun availability increases the risk for dangerous shootings.</p> <p>The government requires background checks on all people purchasing guns to make it hard for shooters to buy them. Background checks are vital in the enforcement of gun laws and in ensuring that guns do not land in the wrong hands (Bieler et al., 2014). Since the law was passed, the rate of gun homicide has reduced by forty percent, and the rate of gun suicides has decreased by 15%. The federal regulations require that every purchaser of handguns must be twenty-one years of age. Raising the minimum age to 21 is significant in preventing gun ownership by school-age shooters.</p> <p>Additionally, the local government plans to direct relief money to prevent gun violence. The funding could go a long way in helping organizations and cities to address the mental health problems related to violence, including depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In areas where gun violence is prevalent, the government pulled out a plan to address individuals’ fears, anger, and pain to reduce the risk of conflict resolution in dangerous or fatal ways (Diaz, 2013). For instance, in D.C., leaders set up a program to offer grants to individuals and groups promoting public safety.</p> <p>The number of deaths by gun violence increased at a very high rate in the last year due to the covid-19 pandemic. This year the number of shootings has decreased compared to the previous year. This signifies that the pandemic is the most significant underlying cause for gun violence. “The downtown area of Washington, D.C. and the east have always been areas where shootings are frequent. I once encountered a shooting in Adams Morgan last year. The shooting happened only two blocks away from me. It was horrible.”,Sherry Den, an H.R. officer in an I.T. company in D.C., said,” As a Chinese, I am amazed that there are so many shootings in the U.S. capital.” The total number of shootings has certainly decreased because of the measures taken by the government to reduce and prevent more gun violence from occurring. However, in another interview, The gun violence pandemic has also claimed the lives of young people and children. Bingru Wang, DC’s correspondent of China Phoenix Satellite T.V., said, “During my years as a reporter, I have often been exposed to shootings that took place here. I remember two particularly brutal shootings this year. One was the sound of gunshots during a baseball game at Washington National Stadium. And about the same time, there was a six-year-old girl who was involved in a gun battle nearby and died.”</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Undoubtedly, there has been an increase in gun violence in Washington DC during the covid-19 pandemic. Homicides in the district are on the same level as they were at the same time last year. The crime has gone down by two percent compared to the year 2020. It is certainly not good news that the gun violence levels are still high during the pandemic. However, the cases this year have not increased from the last year. Gun violence cases have claimed many lives and instilled fear in those living in high crime zones. Therefore, the government needs to reduce the causes of gun violence considerably.</p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>Irvin-Erickson, Y., Lynch, M., Gurvis, A., Mohr, E., &amp; Bai, B. (2017).
