It was 6:30 p.m. on a Friday, and his pizza spot should have been filling up with hungry families, yet only a quarter of the restaurant was occupied.</p> <p>The Tenleytown location of Pete’s New Haven Style Pizza survived the pandemic by adapting to its customers’ safety needs and delivery demand, but months after other business sectors regained strength the restaurant has still not reached its past level of business.</p> <p>“We’re ready for them and we need them,” said Marr. “We’ve got the staff and supplies, but the customers just won’t come,”</p> <p>Despite some return to normalcy, the DC restaurant industry currently lags far behind the national restaurant industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p>With <a href="https://coronavirus.dc.gov/data/vaccination">80% of the city partially or fully vaccinated</a>, many sectors of business have almost fully returned to their 2019 levels of contribution to the district’s GDP, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p> <p>The local food and beverage sector is far from its past revenue, and analysis has little hope for a quick recovery.</p> <p>Data recorded by the online reservation service OpenTable shows how in-person dining has changed by comparing this year’s rates to those before the pandemic. Although in-person dining is at a national low, the district remains around 30% lower than this average.</p> <iframe title="Weekly Seated Diners" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-mmJWU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mmJWU/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>Delivery services have replaced much of this lost business, theorizes the reservation service. Other economic indicators, however, demonstrate that this substitute is not enough.</p> <p>Loan analysis company LendingTree <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/business/best-places-to-open-a-restaurant/">published its own analysis</a> of five market metrics to predict the likelihood of restaurant recovery in major US cities, and placed Washington, DC at the very bottom of its list.</p> <p>Due to its large decrease in consumer spending in restaurants, industry employment and other factors, the analysis predicts that the nation’s capital is least likely to regain its strength in the coming months.</p> <p>LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz stated that larger, more expensive cities are inherently difficult places for restaurants to survive.</p> <p>“The sheer amount of restaurant options that are available in those areas plays a big role,” said Schulz. “That’s true even in the best of times. Factor in a pandemic, and it all just gets exponentially more difficult,”</p> <p>Many national attempts to preserve the food and beverage sector have proved to be lifelines for restaurants in the district. The Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Fund gave nearly a billion dollars to restaurants, bars, and food counters in Washington.</p> <iframe title="Restaurant Revitalization Fund Grant Recipients" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-3aYBU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3aYBU/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="731"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>Money from the RRF, a subsidiary of the Small Business Administration, does not need to be paid back. The funds can be used for payroll, rent and other business expenses until March of 2023.</p> <p>“RRF money was a saving grace,” said manager Ben Noval as he motioned to the outdoor seating the funds helped purchase at his Dupont Circle restaurant.</p> <p>Noval was forced to lay off 14 of his colleagues and close friends at the outset of the pandemic and has only been able to hire back eight of them. To date, the pandemic has caused over 30,000 job losses in Washington restaurants, according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics.</p> <p>“We can barely keep up with the little business that we’re getting,” said Noval. “Now is the time that we need more staff, and now is the time that we need more funding,”</p> <p>The National Restaurant Association has been extensively campaigning for more federal money to be put into the RRF and redistributed before the end of the year. Little movement in congress has been caused by the requests.</p> <p>Locally, the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington has been providing relief to laid off industry workers through a donation based fund. With no financial ability to help entire restaurants, RAMW supports the National Restaurant Association’s advocacy and tries to increase the sense of community between restaurants in the district.</p> <p>This sense of community is what both Marr and Noval believe has kept the industry alive throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>“Restaurants, especially those owned by minorities, are very connected to one another,” said Noval. “Competition is very real, of course, but we’re all in this together,”</p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8039961"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>Washington restaurants that received RRF grants had one of the highest percentages of female-owned restaurants.</p> <p>Nationally, restaurants employ more minority managers than any other industry, according to the National Restaurant Association.</p> <p>These minority-owned restaurants unofficially banded together during the pandemic to help one another, reported restaurant workers.</p> <p>‘Little Ethiopia’ on U and 9th street has become a culinary hotspot for all Washington residents and witnessed this community action first hand.</p> <p>The restaurants of the Shaw corner were hit hard by the pandemic, forcing many to close their doors.</p> <p>Kaleb Tswafe moved to Washington from Ethiopia several years ago and began chasing memories from home in the kitchens of the area. He quickly learned to love Little Ethiopia, and was distraught when the pandemic forced many restaurants to close.</p> <p>“You can see people running produce across the street to their competition,” Tswafe said. “That’s something you’ll only get between two Ethiopian restaurants and that’s the way out of this mess,”</p> <p>Almost none of these restaurants received any federal loans or grants, and have relied on their communities for relief.</p> <p>“There’s a problem affecting all the restaurants here and we’ve gotta fix it,” said Tswafe. “We’re not far from healed but we’ll get there together,”</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/fall-2021/goodreads-covid-19/">&laquo; Good for Goodreads: Reading Grows in Popularity amid COVID-19 Pandemic</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/fall-2021/tax-feminine-products/">More Tax and Less Pay &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/fall-2021/images/Closed-Sign.jpeg" alt="For DC Restaurants, the Pandemic Persists"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/goodreads-covid-19/">Good for Goodreads: Reading Grows in Popularity amid COVID-19 Pandemic</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/tax-feminine-products/">More Tax and Less Pay</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/gay-bars-closing/">Where Did The Gay Bars Go?</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/fall-2021/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
