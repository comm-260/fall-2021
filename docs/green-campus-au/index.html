The next year, the University created its Office of Sustainability to promote sustainable living and service, according to <a href="https://www.american.edu/about/sustainability/milestones.cfm">AU’s Sustainability website</a>.</p> <p>Over that past 10 years, AU installed a solar hot water system, its first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified Building, the creation of a fossil-free fund and its first sustainability plan, among other sustainability achievements, according to the Sustainability website.</p> <p>The first sustainability plan for the University was created in 2010, as well as the Zero Waste Policy. During that same year, AU established its goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2020—a goal it reached two years prior in 2018.</p> <p>According to Second Nature, an organization that manages the <a href="https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/network/">Presidents’ Climate Leadership Commitments and the Climate Leadership Network</a>, carbon neutrality is defined as “having no net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.”</p> <h2 id="achieving-the-carbon-neutrality-title">Achieving the carbon neutrality title</h2> <p>There are two ways in which these emissions are reduced: eliminating net GHG emissions and or the minimization of GHG emissions. This process includes purchasing “carbon offsets or other measures to mitigate the remaining emissions,” according to Second Nature.</p> <p>One of these mitigation efforts is achieved through the purchase of renewable energy credits (RECs). According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/repowertoolbox/renewable-energy-certificate-monetization">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>, RECs are defined as “tradeable, market-based instrument(s) that represent the legal property rights to the ‘renewable-ness.” In other words, this allows AU to offset what the campus emits.</p> <p>The process for determining emissions falls into three categories: Scope 1: emissions directly from campus, Scope 2: purchased electricity and Scope 3: indirect emissions, or everything that doesn’t fall directly into Scope 1 and 2, according to <a href="https://www.american.edu/about/sustainability/tracking-progress.cfm">AU’s tracking process</a>. The reduction or elimination of these categories leads to carbon neutrality.</p> <p>However, in recent times, this title has come under scrutiny as AU cannot physically be carbon neutral, but rather, gains its neutrality through purchasing RECs and external efforts.</p> <h2 id="emissions-growth-over-time">Emissions growth over time</h2> <p>Since 2004, the total combustion and emissions of the University rose by almost 6%. According to the EPA, the process for RECs works so that for every emission output, the buyer needs to increase the RECs to match, or buy more RECs to exceed the emission output. So, as AU increases its emissions, they also increase their purchase of RECs.</p> <iframe title="AU Emissions and RECs, 2004-2019" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-8i5qE" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8i5qE/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="445"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <p>AU uses its carbon neutrality status in its branding, marketing and admissions campaigns. However, AU is carbon neutral on paper, rather than through physical practice. Instead of expanding and investing in on-campus resources, like solar panels, wind generation and other renewable energy methods, the University invested in a solar farm in North Carolina.</p> <h2 id="how-au-got-the-title">How AU got the title</h2> <p>Tacy Lambiase is the Sustainability Manager at AU’s Office of Sustainability. Among other things, she is one of many who oversee the sustainability agenda of the University and the community outreach of resources.</p> <p>The data collection process to calculate the emissions includes an institutional survey.</p> <p>“We do an annual inventory every year. To collect data, we calculate faculty, staff and students’ emissions across campus. A portion of our community gets surveyed every year,” Lambiase said.</p> <p>Then, the Office of Institutional Research calculates the percentages needed to survey the community, as well as the estimated target response rate for the community, Lambiase said.</p> <p>The survey consists of a list of questions regarding personal emissions. For example, transportation needs like commute time or plane mileage for study abroad are questions in the survey.</p> <p>“We are able to get a pretty good sense of how our community is emitting, and the implications related to that,” Lambiase said.</p> <p>To become carbon neutral, the University needs to produce enough renewable energy or purchase offsets to achieve neutrality. There needs to be enough of these resources to exceed, or match, the campus carbon emissions.</p> <p>There are multiple strategies used to achieve neutrality.</p> <p>“The first is to reduce emissions as much as possible. The second is changing the sources of fuel on campus, like the University’s switch from steam to low temperature hot water,” Lambiase said.</p> <p>The last method of zero net emissions includes a monetary investment.</p> <p>“And the third is investing in 100% renewable energy,” Lambiase said.</p> <p>The budget for the purchases of RECs comes from the Facilities Management budget, according to Lambiase.</p> <p>AU has to rely on such external methods for carbon neutrality investment due to limited campus space. In other words, AU does not have the physical space to provide solar and wind resources to overcome the campus electricity and power needs, Lambiase said.</p> <p>Since AU is an urban campus and doesn’t have the space to build entire farms, they built an off-campus solar farm in <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/george-washington-university-american-university-make-deal-to-buy-solar-power-farms--104425">North Carolina</a>. The entire farm contains a quarter of a million solar panels, but the output of these meets only 50% of the campus electricity needs.</p> <p>“The energy that is generated by those solar panels is going to the local North Carolina grid. The energy goes to those communities…they are not directly traveling to D.C.,” Lambiase said.</p> <p>In addition to these solar and wind farms, RECs are purchased to help offset the energy coming from D.C.’s energy grid.</p> <p>Part of this investment also includes on-campus renewables, such as the solar panels on 10 of AU’s rooftops.</p> <p>“We are looking to expand that,” Lambiase said. It’s important to note that, despite the 2,500 panels located across campus, it only covers half of a percent of the campus needs, Lambiase said.</p> <p>Carbon neutrality comes from this plethora of emission resources and solutions. However, it does not allow AU to hold the most carbon-neutral school in America. AU has not claimed such a title but holds the “first large campus and the first university to become carbon neutral,” according to Second Nature.</p> <p>This makes some students skeptical of AU’s sustainability commitment.</p> <p>Some students are concerned with the greenwash effect. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp">Greenwashing</a> is the phenomenon or the practice of “making unwarranted or overblown claims of sustainability or environmental friendliness in an attempt to gain market share,” according to Environmental Health Perspectives.</p> <h2 id="how-does-au-measure-up-in-the-us">How does AU measure up in the U.S.?</h2> <p>Since 2018, the EPA archives the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/green-power-partnership-top-30-college-university-pdfs">top 30</a> carbon neutral colleges in America, on an almost quarterly basis.</p> <iframe title="AU ranking in Top 30 Green Schools, 2018-2021" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-klc6w" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/klc6w/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <p>According to the EPA, while AU is in the top 30 carbon-neutral colleges, it has never come in first place, nor the top 10.

He oversees the campus recycling process and works to implement community outreach. He’s witnessed the evolution of campus sustainability as a student and now a staff member.</p> <p>“There was a really big push around 2018…with the three bins,” Cross said in an interview. “We work with a partner facility, Prince George’s County Composting Facility, for composting. We can’t send any contaminates,” Cross said.</p> <p>That’s where student volunteers, <a href="https://www.american.edu/about/sustainability/get-involved/ecorep-program.cfm">EcoReps</a>, come in. One job of the volunteers is to check and sort bags for possible contaminants.</p> <p>Looking past the last few years, AU has plans to become completely zero waste by 2030—a step that requires “all work on all ends,” Cross said.</p> <p>Mimi Beckemeier is an Environmental Studies and Computer Science major, and volunteers at the Office of Sustainability as an EcoRep. Her line of work includes sustainable volunteering, working with 4Ocean, and updating her sustainability blog with resources for the public.</p> <p>“AU is doing a good job of improving… sustainable living, however, there is always room for improvement. There is a plan in the works for this already, but the biggest thing I would say is to get rid of single-use plastics in our dining halls,” Beckemeier said.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-many-universities-are-in-the-us-and-why-that-number-is-changing">U.S. News</a>, there are 3,982 colleges in America. By looking at AU’s commitment to environmental sustainability, they rank higher than the majority of colleges and universities in the U.S.</p> <p>This commitment to the environment can be seen in a variety of environmental science and sustainability programs as well as clubs, and even in the Office of Sustainability. To that end, many students also share this commitment to greater environmental justice.</p> <p>“Aside from individual actions such as eating less meat, thrifting…there is an abundance of programs, resources and people willing to help students turn sustainable,” Beckemeier said.</p> <p>Beckemeier acknowledges that while AU has employed many tactics in overcoming carbon emissions, there are areas that could use improvements, such as plastic-free lunches, farmers’ markets and outdoor events.</p> <p>“It looks like more environmental organizations, environmental legislation, and more environmental education,” Beckemeier said.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/fall-2021/mental-health-covid-19/">&laquo; The Pandemic Mental Health Crisis: How the world is healing after a year of struggle</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/fall-2021/young-anxiety-covid-19/">The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a rise in anxiety among young adults &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/fall-2021/images/ranking.png" alt="How green is the grass on the Friedham Quad?"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/goodreads-covid-19/">Good for Goodreads: Reading Grows in Popularity amid COVID-19 Pandemic</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/pandemic-restaurants-dc/">For DC Restaurants, the Pandemic Persists</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/tax-feminine-products/">More Tax and Less Pay</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/fall-2021/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
