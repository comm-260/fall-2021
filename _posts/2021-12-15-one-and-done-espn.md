Despite the assumption that many will make the NBA after their senior year, the majority of ESPN top 100 high school basketball players either stay in college for more than one year before making it to the NBA or never make it at all. Each year [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings) ranks who they think are the top 100 male basketball players in each high school grade. There are famous [NBA](https://www.nba.com/draft/2021/draft-board) players who were on these lists when they were younger. Players that make the NBA after a single year of college basketball are known as [“One and Dones”]( https://www.sports-king.com/dictionary.php?q=one-and-done). Many of these NBA players played in a competitive basketball league known as AAU, the [Amateur Athletic Union](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/aau). 

Within AAU circles, many of the ranked players are assumed to be future NBA players, specifically after one year of college. One way to see the accuracy of ESPN’s rankings is to see how many ranked high school seniors do this over a certain time frame. 

Over a ten year period, only 7% of ESPN ranked senior basketball players became NBA players after one year of college, according to an analysis of [ESPN’s 2007-2017](http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings) rankings and [Basketball References’](https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2018.html) NBA draft boards from 2008-2018. 

As a result of this, it is apparent that the majority of players, 93%, did not become NBA players after one year of college. This does not mean that the majority did not make the NBA eventually, but it means that many did not make the immediate jump that is desired by AAU players or predicted by recruiters. 

The ESPN rankings do not promise anything, but these percentages definitely go against the idea that a placement there is super substantial when it comes to making the NBA eventually.

Jalen “Bo” Montgomery is a sophomore basketball player for the college, Holy Cross. In his hometown of Memphis, he played AAU from elementary school to high school. Playing competitive basketball exposed him to the world of rankings and put him in proximity to players who were ranked and were expected to eventually become professionals. 

Montgomery said that when he was in high school, coaches couldn’t see players in person sometimes, so they would evaluate players by using rankings. They wanted to see what other people thought about the players, said Montgomery. 

Montgomery added, “I think the rankings are kind of fluffed.” 

Montgomery explained that rankings are sometimes based on connections and who people know in the AAU system. 

Rankings are “hit or miss”, said Montgomery. 

Montgomery said, “you can’t determine if a player will make the NBA, from high school. That's a far distance.”

Montgomery called rankings a distraction for AAU players. Montgomery recalled that sometimes players would shoot way too much and only focus on their own stats, not winning the game.

“Rankings aren’t based off winning and losing. It's just based off personal performance”, said Montgomery.

The column chart reflects how many players did not become NBA players after one year of college, from 2007 to 2017. 2007 and 2008 tied for the highest number of non-one and dones with 96 in both years. In the ten years, the number of non-one and dones never went below 84, which was the lowest number and also the number from 2016.

The line graph reflects the overall increase of ranked one and dones from 2007 to 2017. 2007 and 2008 were low points but there was an increase in 2009. From 2009 to 2012, the number of players did not really change, but after that, there was a gradual increase with 2016 being the highest point with 16 one and dones. Over the ten year period, the number of one and dones barely went into double digits. In the ten year period there were only three instances where a high school class had more than 10 players become NBA players after one year of college. 

[Zachary Coopersmith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-coopersmith-870a62196)is the head student manager for American University’s men’s basketball team. He has talked to both American University basketball coaches and players about their thoughts on high school basketball rankings. 

Coopersmith said, “rankings can be accurate, but it is a political game.”
The best players are definitely ranked the highest, but there are exceptions said Coopersmith. For example, Coopersmith added that American University’s best player ever was a two star high school recruit who now plays professional basketball in another country.  

Coopersmith noted Kwame Brown, a five star high school recruit who did terribly in the NBA.

When it comes to how rankings are determined, Coopersmith said people usually think, “how much money can this player make me.”

“Marketable” players are promoted, as a result, said Coopersmith. 
Coopersmith also discussed the factors that contribute to rankings and basketball success.

Coopersmith said that there are good players in lower college divisions but things like academics prevented them from playing in Division 1, the best college division.  

In addition to this, rankings can be affected by a player’s location, said Coopersmith. If there are two equally good players from Montana and Atlanta, it is likely that the one from Atlanta would be ranked higher, said Coopersmith.
