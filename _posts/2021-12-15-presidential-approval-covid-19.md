COVID-19 has taken over the world in many ways over the course of the past 20 months, including the political realm. People have looked to the government for guidance during the unprecedented time. But, when things don’t go as planned, people often blame those in charge.

Patterns emerge as one examines the rise and fall in COVID cases and the approval and disapproval ratings of both Biden and Trump. Biden’s lowest approval rating was on Oct. 19, where only 42 percent of the country approved of his job performance. Trump’s lowest approval rating, barring the week following Jan. 6, to exempt any outside influence, occurred during the week of Jun. 30, 2020. His approval rating was at 38 percent, the lowest during the pandemic.

The first lockdown occurred in March, almost three months before Trump’s lowest approval rating, again barring the week of Jan. 6. This lockdown was supposed to help slow down the growth in cases and keep people safe. There were several repercussions to the lockdown, however. 

Throughout the pandemic, it is important to note, that there are some other factors that impacted Trump’s approval rating. There was an increasing awareness of issues of police brutality in the US, and Trump’s reaction could play an important enough role to note. Additionally, in the month of March, there was a build-up to complete shutdown, which allowed people to become more aware of the dire situation the pandemic would bring. 

When [New York](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/year-covid-19-us-march-2020/story?id=76204691) became harshly hit with cases, the rest of the US had to react. When Trump first spoke to the entire nation regarding the pandemic, it was when he declared a state of emergency. There was little information from the government regarding COVID before Trump’s initial address. 

[AP News](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-public-health-tulsa-oklahoma-florida-56b56d4848bbe5b41060e7b3a5e459bb) reported that on Trump’s last full day in office, the US hit 400,000 deaths from the coronavirus. Throughout Trump’s presidency, COVID cases fluctuated, peaking during his last month in office.

His approval rating was also at it its second lowest point during the time under his administration where there were the most reported COVID cases. The week of Jan. 6 was the lowest, however, that is left out of analysis due to overwhelming outside influence.

Trump’s approval/disapproval ratings significantly fluctuated throughout his presidency. Some disagreed with his COVID approach, and others had issues with the way he handled other issues. As shown by the drop in approval ratings around June, some disagreed with the timing of the reopening of businesses. 

Kayla Smith, a graduate student at American University, believes that Trump’s distrust in science created a lot of problems for the United States long-term. “His lack of faith in science and medical professionals was fatal for a lot of people,” she said.  

Almost a full year into the pandemic, Biden took office in a time of complete disarray. There was a lot of controversy surrounding Trump, given the events of January 6th and the attitude about the election. When he entered office, the country was also amid a surge due to holiday gatherings. 

The widespread availability of vaccines took place during Biden’s presidency, which helped the case levels drop. However, there is still some vaccine hesitancy from a group of Americans, which could be left over from the Trump administration and their rhetoric toward the vaccine.

The increases are far less dramatic during 2021 than they were the previous year. This can be attributed to several different factors, but it is interesting to note how the slow increase of cases has impacted Biden’s approval rating.

The timeline of the approval ratings is somewhat un-uniform when it comes to the dates. After speaking with one of the co-directors of the American Presidency Project, John Woolley, who provided context to the dates of the polling data. Woolley explained that because they strictly use Gallup polling, and their data has become less continuous over time, that the time periods will fluctuate. Woolley also explained that the American Presidency Project uses strictly Gallup polling data because their data has been consistent for the longest period.

When looking at the bigger picture, it is important to outline significant events. For example, vaccine rollout began in December, but did not accelerate to large portions of the population until April, after Biden took office, according to BBC News. 

In addition to vaccine rollout, there have been other monumental events regarding COVID that have been impactful. The Delta Variant that emerged late summer 2021 caused an immediate rise in cases, even amongst the fully vaccinated. Also, various travel bans have been put in place to help combat the spread of the virus, but they have had social and economic consequences. 

Conducting a side-by-side comparison of the patterns between COVID cases and approval ratings allows for more precise patterns to be observed.

Randi Rashkover, a voter who is a self-proclaimed close examiner of COVID news, believes that the Presidents, both Trump and Biden, are not fully to blame for the disaster of the pandemic. She believes that both Biden and Trump made mistakes and did not properly communicate with the American public. However, Trump’s efforts were much more of a problem.

“Trump was a rhetorical disaster,” said Rashkover. 

Although conducting a statistical analysis on the two factors does not yield a correlation when looking at all of the data from 2020-2021, the visualization presented shows a small pattern. COVID cases have had a small impact on the approval ratings of the Presidents who have served over nearly the past two years. The political divide in the US has also played a significant role, according to Rashkover. However, whether it be Trump or Biden, people have had issues with how the pandemic has been handled since the beginning. When it comes to Trump, however, there is a stronger correlation found and is considered significant. His approval ratings show a correlation with the number of COVID cases. It is important to understand that there are other factors at play, but overall, Trump saw more of an influence on his approval ratings due to COVID than Biden.
