Kayla Kelly walks down Wisconsin Avenue carrying a large bag filled with toothbrushes, granola bars and gloves.

Kelly, who runs mutual aid Heal Da Homies, is one of many D.C. residents working to combat gentrification in the district.

Gentrification in D.C. is on the rise as Black residents, who once made up over half of district residents, has dropped to just 46%, all while housing prices are rising.

The average median housing cost per zip code in 2015 was just under $600,000. White residents, on average, made up around 47% of each zip code’s population. Black residents made up 45%.

Black residents were much more likely to live in zip codes with lower housing costs. In the zip codes with the three lowest median housing prices, Black residents made up an average of 95% of residents, while white residents made up an average of only 4%.

In the three zip codes with the highest median housing prices, white residents made up an average of 81% of residents, while Black residents made up an average of only 8%.

Much of this can be attributed to racist housing restrictions that have historically prevented Black people from attaining housing, according to Christina Juhasz-Wood, a professor of American studies at American University.

“We can see throughout American history there’s been prevention of Black families from getting nice housing, which leads there to be ‘white’ and ‘Black’ neighborhoods, with Black neighborhoods typically having worse housing” Juhasz-Wood said.

Kelly, who works to provide food and hygiene resources to homeless in D.C. agreed. 

“You see houses east of the [Anacostia] river and they look nothing like the mansions you see in the Northwest. It’s almost like it’s not the same city,” Kelly said. “It’s basically legalized segregation. We give Black folks worse housing because they’re seen as disposable.”

Black residents have been increasingly pushed out of D.C., especially as housing prices rise.

In the three zip codes with the lowest median housing prices in 2015, in 2021 the prices jumped an average of $83,800, with the percent of Black residents staying relatively the same.

In the three zip codes with the highest median housing prices in 2015, in 2021 prices rose by only $43,000. White residents have jumped to making up an average of 96% of these zip codes.

Much of this change can be attributed to the pandemic and its disproportionate impact on the Black community, according to Jessica Owens-Young, a professor of public health at American University.

“We saw higher rates of spread in Black communities and we’re continuing to see higher rates of Black unemployment compared to other populations,” said Owens-Young.

Black unemployment in D.C. is just over 11%, compared to just under 2% for white residents, according to the [Economic Policy Institute.](https://www.epi.org/indicators/state-unemployment-race-ethnicity-2019q4/)

“You look at who is being impacted by the pandemic and its Black folks. We’re the ones getting sick, we’re the ones getting evicted, we’re the ones dying,” Kelly said.
