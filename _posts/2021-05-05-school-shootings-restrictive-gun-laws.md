A generation of students has been raised to fear school shootings.

 There have been over 1,000 incidents of gun violence in the United States reported in the [K-12 School Shooting Database](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/data-map/) since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. With that, comes over twenty-six hundred victims either injured or killed. 

The number of children who witness the violence and/or experience PTSD and other forms of anxiety disorders due to gun violence at school is more than a staggering [248,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-database/?utm_term=.31abe27c1082). Students now worry more about a shooting happening at their school than [peer pressure](https://www.childrensdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YouGov-SafeSchools-Final-Sep-18-2018.pdf). 

Despite all the gun violence children experience in the United States, [gun lobbyist](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/us/politics/nra-gun-control.html) groups continue to block progress in Washington. The gun lobby has long perpetuated an extremist view of the Second Amendment, with no wiggle room for common sense gun safety protections. With the right laws, school shootings can be prevented. States with stronger gun laws have less gun violence. 

In response to the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018, which resulted in the deaths of 17 students, Wayne LaPieree, the CEO of the NRA called for arming teachers. 

“Every day, young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide-open, soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder,” said LaPieree. 

[Studies](https://giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Truth-About-School-Shootings-Report.pdf) have shown that the risks associated with gun access vastly outweigh the likelihood of self-defense use. “Whether or not I’m pro-gun, I don’t wan’t a gun in the classroom, it puts my students in unnecessary danger.” said Toni Jones, a kindergarten teacher for DCPS.

Students across the nation already go through anxiety-inducing active-shooter drills, a gun is an added stress. “When we go into lockdown, the kids are scared because someone is tugging at the door, I have to reassure the kids they are safe, even if I can’t guarantee it,” said Jones. 

Threats of an active-shooter negatively impact students' learning and overall school experience. In addition to the emotional toll of regular drills and frequent shootings across the country, the family partnerships are also harmed. Jones notes, “New security and growing fears of threats against the school doesn’t allow for a lot of family relationships, we can’t have volunteers in the class like we used to.”

While guns in the classroom is not the answer, Jones acknowledges there is a fine line between school safety and over policing, which tends to disproportionately punish students-of-color. “The current system needs to be redesigned and reformed, so we can feel safe at school, without having to worry about which students are getting unfairly punished.”

The 2008 ruling in the *District of Columbia v. Heller* marked the first Supreme Court ruling on the Second Amendment in nearly 70 years. The court ruled in favor of Dick Heller who sued D.C. over its ban at handguns in the home. In the decision, Justice Scalia affirmed the individual's right to keep handguns at one's home for self-defense, while still stressing the limited nature of the ruling. 

“Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. [It is] not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”

In regards to gun laws, states vary on everything from background check procedures to mental health reporting. The vast difference of gun laws and ownership by states attributes to gun violence. For instance, California, Massachusetts, and Connecticut have the most laws on the books all around approximately [one-hundred](https://www.statefirearmlaws.org), while Iowa and Idaho are tied for dead last. 

Firearms left unsecured in the [home](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Truth-About-School-Shootings-Report.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619583672120000&usg=AOvVaw32IFV5_6lv0MnzXKytfzwa) are a major source of guns used in school shootings. With that being said, it is essential to have an accurate record of gun sales. An accurate record can help keep guns out of undesirable hands. 

Child access prevention (CAP) laws encourage safe storage of firearms by holding adults accountable when children gain access to their guns. Evidence shows these laws work to prevent unauthorized firearm access. A 1997 [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/418289) found that CAP laws were associated with a 23% decrease in accidental shooting death among children younger than 15-years-old. Fourteen states have implemented CAP laws, but specifics vary. The majority of states with CAP laws require the child to use the firearm. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-slope" data-src="visualisation/5987013"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Four states, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Maryland have the [strictest](https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/child-consumer-safety/child-access-prevention/) CAP laws that impose criminal liability when a minor is merely likely to gain access to a gun that is negligently stored. 

73-percent of children under 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents’ firearms, and 36-percent admitted they had [handled](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/204929) the weapons.

With over 700 thousand registered guns, Texas has the most firearms of any state. Additionally, Texas has the most school shootings in the county, per 100 thousand people. Followed by Louisiana, Delaware, and Alabama.

The states with the lowest rates of gun violence in K-12 schools, since Columbine, are Massachusetts, New York, North Dakota and Hawaii. 

Based on existing gun laws, legal gun ownership, and previous school shootings, Idaho, Missouri, Iowa, Texas, and Georgia have the least amount of measures in place to prevent gun violence, when taking into account the amount of registered guns in the state. 

The restrictiveness of state gun laws is associated with the rate of school shootings in the United States. This has a major impact on K-12 students. Children who experience school shootings can suffer severe anxiety and debilitating trauma. 

Dr. Jill Bohnenkamp, an assistant professor and faculty at the Center for School Mental Health at the University of Maryland, spoke on the effect of living in the current climate of gun violence. Dr. Bohnenkamp has experience in school mental health research, policy and clinical practice at the local, state, and national levels. Her research focuses on school safety outcomes of school mental health service provisions and mental health training for educators. 

“Pervasive gun violence contributes to feelings of unsafety in school. Teachers are integral to addressing children’s mental health needs in schools, yet they report limited training in mental health and behavior management in the classroom”, said Dr. Bohnenkamp.

The SAS estimates that American citizens own [393 million guns](https://wamu.org/story/20/09/18/how-many-people-in-the-u-s-own-guns/), making the U.S. ranked number one in firearms per capita. A majority of gun owners cite *protection* as their primary reason for owning a gun. A 2015 Harvard [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743515001188) found that people defended themselves with a gun in less than 1 percent of 14 thousand crimes from 2007-11.

By contrast, [research](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M13-1301&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619584295209000&usg=AOvVaw0J4L30HWAGNy3ndJ_SeSEO) has shown that guns in the home are far more likely to be used for suicide or homicide, rather than for self-defense. 

A number of effective policy solutions can better protect children from violence. [Research](https://giffords.org/issues/kids-and-guns/) indicates, closing background check loopholes, investing in community-based violence intervention programs, and child access prevention laws can have positive impacts on the current rate of gun violence affecting children in the United States. 

The 2020 election resulted in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota legalizing recreational marijuana. Earlier this year, Illinois was also added to that list. As of this year, marijuana is fully legal in 16 states, including the District of Columbia. Additionally, 42 states have either decriminalized marijuana, allow medicinal marijuana or both. In seven states, CBD oil is the only legal form.

This is still a relatively new process in the US, as the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, Colorado and Washington, only passed their laws in 2012. In less than a decade, more research has been done. Public opinion and discourse has also adapted in the last few years.

Young voters in particular have shown an upward trend in support. From 1994 to 2018, support for the legalization of marijuana amongst voters aged 18-34 has increased by almost 50%. To find recent data, Gallup released a poll "Americans' Support for Legalizing Marijuana Among Demographic Groups," however their age categories were slightly different than that of AP's data. Nonetheless, as of 2020, we can assume around 77% of voters in that age category show their support.

In many states, citizens have to be 21 years or older to purchase marijuana, yet that did not stop eager voters aged 18-20 to vote in favor of these new laws. In an Instagram survey with 115 responses from college aged, 18-22 years old individuals, more than 93% said the federal government should decriminalize marijuana. This was a major difference from the amount of individuals who live in a state where that is the current law, just under 23%.

American University sophomore Joe Smieya voted in favor of recreational marijuana in New Jersey this past election. Although Smieya is only 19, he is excited to have the ability to legally use marijuana back home, once he is of age.

Nevertheless, Smieya, and many others, understand the complexities of this issue and see it for more than an opportunity to get high. Smieya believes that these new laws are helpful, but not enough to end the stigma around marijuana.

"Decriminalization is not enough in a lot of ways. Marijuana still suffers from the inherent harms of prohibition. There is unequal advocacy of laws for certain groups of people. These unequal applications are typically against POC and it harms them more than anyone else," said Smieya.

Racial injustice became increasingly discussed in 2020 after the George Floyd protests this summer. When it comes to the decriminalization of marijuana, one can look at the racial components of the war on drugs.

Atlas Klus, a 19-year-old American University student, also voted in favor of marijuana's legalization in New Jersey. However, their focus was on protecting BIPOC rather than a personal desire to smoke.

"POC are prosecuted much more harshly and more often for marijuana related crimes and yet almost every young white boy I know smokes and they never get caught," said Klus.

Making sure the legalization process is both beneficial and equitable has been a balancing act for Virginian legislatures. Their Governor Ralph Northam has made a commitment to legalizing recreational marijuana in 2021. For Illinois cannabis legalization expert Toi Hutchinson, it is of extreme importance that marijuana legalization not only uplift black communities through the legislation process, but through recognizing its social implications.

According to NBC 12, on Wednesday this week, Hutchinson joined the "Legalize It" virtual series run by the Tom Tom Foundation. There, she spoke more to addressing the issue of the criminalization of marijuana, particularly among young, black Virginians, and the implications of Governor Northam's 2021 promise.

"It is one of the first ways, you get introduced, especially young African American boys between 18 and 24, introduced into the criminal justice system. And that has impacts for the rest of their lives for all of these families, for blocks and blocks of people," said Hutchinson. "Equity in this space is about taking communities who have been harmed and giving them what they need to be in a position to be treated equally."

The level of government involvement in this issue varies depending on who you ask. However, with public approval rising, as about two thirds of Americans support the legalization of marijuana, pressure is put on politicians to take action.

With the new Biden and Harris administration entering the white house, young voters expressed hope that they would be the team to tackle this issue.

In the same 115 person survey, around 56% believe that a Biden presidency will lead to the decriminalization of marijuana.

Although a majority of those surveyed expressed hope in the new administration, others shared fears and frustrations.

"They [Joe Biden and Kamala Harris] are a bunch of party democrats without a backbone between them," said 21-year-old Ohioan Benjamin Mooney.

As far as what the public knows about their stances on the issue, Harris has been said to be in favor of legalizing marijuana while Biden has expressed a desire to leave it up to individual states.

"Although I would like to believe this administration will be progressive enough to legalize marijuana, Kamala's past does not make me confident," said 18-year-old University of South Carolina student Sophia Troutman.

Troutman is referring to Harris' past as a prosecutor in California where she convicted a high number of residents. She also did not show support for the state's push for legalization in 2016.

Although there are mixed opinions on the likelihood of major change in the next four years, public approval on the issue seems to be heading in a positive direction.

A new Gallup poll demonstrated a record high of 68% approval amongst Americans in regard to the legalization of marijuana.

Matthew Matos, a 22-year-old account coordinator for CGI health and New Jersey resident expressed that public approval will continue to go up as long as there is more conversation to end the stigma around marijuana.

"Of course If you're relying on weed too much or using it to cope with anything it can be dangerous. However, I think more people need to look into its medical benefits," said Matos.

Matos explained that many can overgeneralize the effects of marijuana as they remain ignorant to its complexities. It comes in different strands that give the body different effects that range from increased appetite, pain reduction, relieving anxiety, a feeling of euphoria or even arousal.

He walked through the process of the psychoactive component of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and how that is used to attach to endocannabinoids in one's brain, and eventually cannabinoid receptors to give one's body the feeling of being high.

"I think if you really want to end stigmas about it you have to let people know that although marijuana is a drug, all it is doing is activating something that is already existing in your body," said Matos.
