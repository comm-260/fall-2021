        <title>The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a rise in anxiety among young adults</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mental health among young adults took a dramatic decline in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from the Center for Disease Control and  Prevention shows trends in symptoms of anxiety among the age group between 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stress of maintaining a stellar academic standing, a social life, and an internship or job, among other potential time vacuums, can contribute to feelings of sadness, emptiness, and irritability, all of which were exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic. The vast majority of college students were forced off-campus in March 2020 and made the jarring shift from in-person to online classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time since the great depression, a majority of 52% of young adults lived with one or both of their parents in 2020. For students like myself, this living situation was not chosen, it was forced on us. An inability to socialize with friends and participate in the opportunities offered by college life contributed to a rise in mental health issues for many students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Olivia Alafriz, a sophomore in the School of Communications, living at home was an isolating experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Being inside all the time negatively affected my mood because the lockdown prevented me from seeing my friends. I had no real social interactions for over five months and it was hard not to feel a bit depressed,”” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to her worries was her fear of infecting her immunocompromised 
grandmother, whom she lived with throughout the year. She said she met almost all of her current friends at American through classes this fall and was unable not make many social connections in Zoom classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An annual University of Michigan mental health study found that 66% of 
undergraduate and graduate respondents reported feelings of isolation from others. Social distancing meant students were already at a physical distance from each other, and for most colleges that did reopen in the Fall of 2020, any large social gatherings were strictly prohibited. This made attending college a sometimes even more isolating experience than staying at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethan Dumas, a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island said, “I spent my freshman year on campus but because of the strict social distancing guidelines the only times when I left my dorm room were for meals or exercise. At least at home, I had my dad’s cooking to look forward to every day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side-by-side analysis of data on 18-29-year-olds reporting symptoms of 
anxiety in 2019 and 18-34-year-olds reporting symptoms of anxiety in 2020 shows a dramatic increase in those reporting symptoms after the onset of the pandemic. The data collected by the CDC shows rates of anxiety started at 13.9% in January of 2019 and ended at 13% in December. By May 2020, three months after the first lockdown period began in March, symptoms had increased by a massive 27 points, climbing up to 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;18-29 Year Olds Reporting Symptoms of Anxiety&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-na5cG&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/na5cG/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;COVID-19 Deaths by Month in 2020&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-p3Ytd&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/p3Ytd/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two spikes in symptoms of anxiety in 2020 occurred in the middle of 
Summer, at 46.2%, and in the middle of Autumn, at 50.2% in November. These spikes may correlate to a rise in deaths associated with the virus, which are tracked by month in the chart below. Over the Summer, the second-highest number of deaths reported occurred over July at 31,118 lives lost. Similarly, in the Fall deaths more than doubled from October to November, climbing to 53,223.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;18-34-Year-Olds Reporting Symptoms of Anxiety in 2019&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-TClcW&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TClcW/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election provided another possible source of 
distress for young adults in November. According to a study by the American Psychological Association in October, around two-thirds of all adults (68%) said the election was a significant source of stress in their lives (APA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Zahra Deshaw, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, living at home proved incredibly draining and worsened the mental health issues she already struggles with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was really bad because I already have mental health problems and my 
siblings also have issues so it was hard for my Dad to manage all of our 
problems at once,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zahra is biracial, identifying as white and Bengali. She said living with her 
white father during the pandemic as the only queer brown woman in the 
household caused immense stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m the only queer person in the family and we lived with our white Dad so that made things even more complicated because we were having all these tough conversations about race with a white person. This made me even more depressed because I didn’t have a brown person to talk with, which made me feel isolated,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zahra is referring to the cultural reckoning with police brutality and racism which occurred over the Summer of 2020. She lived in Portland, OR, one of the epicenters for protests over police brutality, which often turned violent, and she said she struggled with her desire to be part of the movement and her fear of being infected. Ultimately, Zahra decided to attend the protests but said she was extra cautious about social distancing and wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Chair of the Psychology Department, Professor Ahrens, “Being a member of an underrepresented group, being queer, in a lot of circles is going to be a chronic stress and if you think about the effects of the additional chronic stress of the pandemic on people who already have chronic stress, you would anticipate that the effects would be stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the intersectional systems of oppression queer women of color like 
Zahra experience, the addition of a new isolating condition to her life posed unique challenges to her mental health. Challenges that she has said have mostly subsided now that she is supported by a network of queer friends in DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The adjustment period for me going from living at home to moving to DC was brief because of how much happier I am living on my own than under my Dad’s roof. I no longer have to walk him through the everyday macroaggressions he subjected me to, whether intentional or not, and that has made all the difference,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked Professor Ahrens for a general assessment of how students mental health levels have changed now that they are back to in-person classes he said, “I’ve certainly heard from many students who just have been so grateful to be back and to see people in person, and it’s, by their reports, made a huge difference. Every student’s experience is different but in general, I see positive trends.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a distinct correlation between a rise in symptoms of depression and anxiety among 18 to 29 year old’s and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As gathered by my data and interviews, college students specifically experienced worsening mental health due to a switch from in-person to online classes, an inability to socialize with friends, and the feelings of isolation brought on by the first lockdown. The contentious 2020 U.S. presidential election also raised levels of anxiety among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Vinyl Record Renaissance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here in the DMV, Dempsey Hamilton owns and operates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobiusrecordshop.com/&quot;&gt;Mobius Records&lt;/a&gt; in Fairfax VA. Opening in 2014, Hamilton operated his store in a small building across from the stores current location. In 2016, he moved to a much larger space due to demand. Hamilton describes his record sales as ÒsustainableÓ but noticed a significant increase in sales in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton’s observations line up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riaa.com/reports/2021-mid-year-music-industry-revenue-report-riaa/&quot;&gt;RIAA data&lt;/a&gt;. Record sales jumped 216.6% between 2014 and 2020. In 2014, at the time of opening, vinyl sales were at 10.32 million. Last year, 22.36 million records were sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/8053682/embed&quot; title=&quot;Interactive or visual content&quot; class=&quot;flourish-embed-iframe&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:600px;&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;flourish-credit&quot; href=&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8053682/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/8053682&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration:none!important&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Made with Flourish&quot; src=&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to RIAA data, the estimated value of vinyl in 2020 was around $12.2 billion. This is nearly double the value of records from the beginning of the decade to now. In addition, a 2018 poll of people 18-65 found that around 9% of people in the US listen to vinyl records. With COVID Lockdowns preventing people from visiting stores and streaming services dominating music consumption in the late 2010’s, how are vinyl records maintaining relevance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/8058976/embed&quot; title=&quot;Interactive or visual content&quot; class=&quot;flourish-embed-iframe&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:600px;&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;flourish-credit&quot; href=&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8058976/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/8058976&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration:none!important&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Made with Flourish&quot; src=&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long before the internet, vinyl records were the primary source of music consumption. According to the RIAA sales database, vinyl sales hit their peak in 1978, selling over 49.3 million records that year. In the 90s, the CD was introduced leading to a major decline in vinyl sales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this jump in sales/demand, record stores like Hamilton’s are struggling with receiving records at a timely manner. ÒIt is a constant battle every week to get new releases in and getting certain titles from certain labels. But yes, we’re seeing a bottleneck in both distribution and manufacturing of records.Ó&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Price of PVC By Year&quot; aria-label=&quot;Column Chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-l1k8F&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/l1k8F/4/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this delay is the rising cost of PVC. PVC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chemorbis.com/en/pvc/polyvinyl-chloride-pvc-plastics-news-prices-analysis&quot;&gt;is the primary resource needed to manufacture a vinyl record.&lt;/a&gt;  This material has been relatively high in price for years, and record plants cannot afford to buy the amount needed to produce at full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are vinyl record sales so high?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Hamilton, Mobius records operated on a ÒhybridÓ model. ÒDuring the lockdown, we moved our inventory online, created a website. We had a presence on discogsÉ and now our business is 50% online, and 50% in person.Ó&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discogs.com/about&quot;&gt;Discogs&lt;/a&gt; is a Òa user-built database of music.Ó Essentially, they’re a website where people log the records they own and discogs keeps track of the different artists and their releases. According to their website, the discogs database had over 7 million artists and 14 million recordings in it. Another feature with discogs is their marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marketplace is a part of the database where people can list records to sell through the database and buyers can purchase them. This marketplace is where Mobius records sold their records during the lockdown. Anyone who owns vinyl can list records to sell on discogs. This marketplace has been a key to keeping vinyl record popularity. Since fans can find obscure records on Discogs without having to go record store hunting, it allows fans of artists to find records faster. In addition, it allows record stores like Mobius to operate online without having to create an entire online store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Adams Morgan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://smash.dead-city.org/wordpress/about&quot;&gt;Smash Records&lt;/a&gt; has been owned and operated by Bobby Poloski. Originally from Georgetown, this store operated there from 1984 until 2006. In Bobby’s view, the decline of the cd led to an increase in record sales. ÒVinyl’s became the bulk of what we sellÉsurprisingly the drop in cd sales coincided with the rise of record sales.Ó&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers match his conclusions. In the 2000s, CD sales plummeted from 93.4% of totals sales in 2002 to just 16.2% of total sales in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of streaming services like Spotify and apple music, vinyl was starting to see the end. However, many factors have led to the rise in vinyl sales in the past decade. Whether it’s easier access to purchasing records, or the decline of cd, vinyl’s are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Effects of Increasing Screen Time on Children</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Children’s minds don’t belong to live behind a screen and they are struggling because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology advances and becomes easier and easier to use and have access to, the amount of time children spend on screens is greatly increasing. And, while there are many advantages to screentime for children, a growing dependence on phones and tablets can be dangerous. Growing up with instant access to technology from an extremely young age, the latest generation of children is being affected emotionally, psychologically and physically from their addiction to screens. This is especially after the COVID-19 Pandemic kept children away playing outside and attending schools in person starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For good or bad reasons, there is no doubt that children have become more dependent on screens, without even factoring in the pandemic yet. Since the introduction of the IPhone and IPad in the early 2000s, children have become more and more familiar with turning to screens for instant gratification and reliable entertainment comfort. Based on a study conducted of 1135 parents throughout the United States, 35.2% of parents believe that cellphone use has a positive effect on their children. With parents believing that they are doing what is best for their child, it is no wonder that cell phone use is on the rise. 35.6% of children spend at least 1-2 hours a day on their phone, and more than 15% spend at least 4 hours a day attached to their personal device. There is starting to become a second pandemic spreading through children around America, cell phone addiction. Even children are aware of the growing dependence on screens. When asked how they feel technology affects their daily lives, a group of 12 to 13 year olds had mixed emotions. Some believed that they need and enjoy the entertainment and social factor their phones provide. However,  many felt as if it distracts them from school and makes them lose motivation, it was even described as a 24/7 constant. Studies show that more kids have their own smartphones than ever before. From 2011 to 2019, the average age of smartphone ownership dropped from 14 to 11. Children don’t even want to go outside anymore, why should they when they are provided with endless amounts of entertainment at their fingertips always. 40% of parents have to force their children to play outside, these children would rather play video games, surf the internet, listen to music, or even do homework rather than go play outside in the open air. Outside play has countless benefits, such as emotional development like building friendships and organizational skills. Also, physical development like fighting against childhood obesity and cardiovascular disease. To continue, the increase in technology use by children was only amplified after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and they were now being encouraged to stay safe which meant staying indoors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the threat of COVID-19 became evident in early 2020, all schools across decided to close their doors, go online, and force children to spend even more time behind a screen. Some schools offered a hybrid model of learning, which still required a great uptick in hours spent online by children. People leaned more toward an all in person and hybrid method of learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[VIZ 1] https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eX71Q/1/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[VIZ 2] https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qoH2K/1/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, screen time amongst teenagers and those aged 13 and under doubled from what it was pre-pandemic. For teens and older kids, lockdown meant missing in person school socialising with friends, and iconic high school memories they will never make up. Those aged 14 through 17 who spent more than four hours a day online skyrocketed from 32% to 62% in the post-pandemic world. However, for younger children, being forced to spend this time isolated meant a lack of face-to-face experiences that are critical for growth and development. When asked to speak about the topic, Veronica Chirlin, Interim Administrator at the American University Child Development Center stated, Ò[Carers] need to put in the time and the child can grow and develop in a positive environment. The pandemic took some of that time away from young growing brains, and it changed the kinds of interactions kids had with their parents and families. It changed how often young kids saw the people around them staring at screens, and not at them or other real peopleÓ It is a new world post-pandemic and these kids are not suited for it after spending what could be the majority of their life behind a screen. She continues, ÒKids are entering the classroom having had vastly different experiences in how much they were socialized or ignored for several months or longer, and how much screen time they have had on a regular basis. It is always possible to get back on the right track to less screen time, and less is better. But, there is no shortcut. It requires putting in the face-to-face quality time and interacting with young children with undivided attention.Ó Realizing that being online for upwards hours in the day affects the development of a young child is just scratching the surface of how the next generation is being affected emotionally and psychologically by their reliance on technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of potential harmful effects that stem from too much screen time for children. These problems include behavioral , educational, physical health and sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[VIZ 3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.canva.com/design/DAEx5vR3J1M/282uES5vNfwpV_N4K7ctgw/view?utm_content=DAEx5vR3J1M&amp;amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_source=sharebutton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most concerning hazard however, is how screen time will affect children mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trauma of the pandemic led children to all different types of mental health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[VIZ 4] https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cDarH/1/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most popular types were ÒFunctional Family TherapyÓ and ÒTransition into IndependenceÓ. These categories are no surprise taking into consideration the types of stress the pandemic ensued in children from having to spend all time at home with their family. It makes sense that they now struggle with family issues and independence. It is likely also that parents’ reliance on technology for raising their children, added to this stress. Lauren Muldowney, 23 year old teaching assistant at Twin Oaks Country Day School stated, ÒEven punishments typically surround the use of a screen. Getting it taken away or getting screen time as a reward/ bribery. Also, especially during COVID…screen time increased significantly. As a result of COVID, a lot of parents are now seen working at home and it’s just easier to stick a child in front of a screen while a parent is busy working. It’s like a free babysitter.Ó It is clear to see that there is a correlation between an increase in children’s reported mental health issues and time spent inside and therefore online. Children are aware of the mental health issues that technology is arising. This can be seen in how the same group of 12-13 as mentioned earlier in the story, also stated how they believe that social media is plummeting their self-confidence and how they are upset by frequent sightings of cyberbullying. It is undeniable that mental health issues arise when children are faced with ample time online. Spending time outside with face to face interaction is not necessarily preferred by children, however, it is extremely important in order to better raise a happy, healthy, confident and well-rounded child.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Presidential Approval Ratings: How much of a role does COVID play in the public’s opinion of the chief executive?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump and Joe Biden have both had their presidency taken over by the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/190449656@N04/50404662486&quot;&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has taken over the world in many ways over the course of the past 20 months, including the political realm. People have looked to the government for guidance during the unprecedented time. But, when things don’t go as planned, people often blame those in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patterns emerge as one examines the rise and fall in COVID cases and the approval and disapproval ratings of both Biden and Trump. Biden’s lowest approval rating was on Oct. 19, where only 42 percent of the country approved of his job performance. Trump’s lowest approval rating, barring the week following Jan. 6, to exempt any outside influence, occurred during the week of Jun. 30, 2020. His approval rating was at 38 percent, the lowest during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first lockdown occurred in March, almost three months before Trump’s lowest approval rating, again barring the week of Jan. 6. This lockdown was supposed to help slow down the growth in cases and keep people safe. There were several repercussions to the lockdown, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the pandemic, it is important to note, that there are some other factors that impacted Trump’s approval rating. There was an increasing awareness of issues of police brutality in the US, and Trump’s reaction could play an important enough role to note. Additionally, in the month of March, there was a build-up to complete shutdown, which allowed people to become more aware of the dire situation the pandemic would bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Health/year-covid-19-us-march-2020/story?id=76204691&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; became harshly hit with cases, the rest of the US had to react. When Trump first spoke to the entire nation regarding the pandemic, it was when he declared a state of emergency. There was little information from the government regarding COVID before Trump’s initial address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-public-health-tulsa-oklahoma-florida-56b56d4848bbe5b41060e7b3a5e459bb&quot;&gt;AP News&lt;/a&gt; reported that on Trump’s last full day in office, the US hit 400,000 deaths from the coronavirus. Throughout Trump’s presidency, COVID cases fluctuated, peaking during his last month in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;2020 Covid Cases&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-IaLgH&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IaLgH/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His approval rating was also at it its second lowest point during the time under his administration where there were the most reported COVID cases. The week of Jan. 6 was the lowest, however, that is left out of analysis due to overwhelming outside influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Trump Approval Ratings&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-VsbeU&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VsbeU/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s approval/disapproval ratings significantly fluctuated throughout his presidency. Some disagreed with his COVID approach, and others had issues with the way he handled other issues. As shown by the drop in approval ratings around June, some disagreed with the timing of the reopening of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kayla Smith, a graduate student at American University, believes that Trump’s distrust in science created a lot of problems for the United States long-term. “His lack of faith in science and medical professionals was fatal for a lot of people,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost a full year into the pandemic, Biden took office in a time of complete disarray. There was a lot of controversy surrounding Trump, given the events of January 6th and the attitude about the election. When he entered office, the country was also amid a surge due to holiday gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread availability of vaccines took place during Biden’s presidency, which helped the case levels drop. However, there is still some vaccine hesitancy from a group of Americans, which could be left over from the Trump administration and their rhetoric toward the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;2021 COVID Cases&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-xlDc4&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xlDc4/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increases are far less dramatic during 2021 than they were the previous year. This can be attributed to several different factors, but it is interesting to note how the slow increase of cases has impacted Biden’s approval rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Biden Approval Ratings&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-PgWgy&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PgWgy/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PgWgy/1/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline of the approval ratings is somewhat un-uniform when it comes to the dates. After speaking with one of the co-directors of the American Presidency Project, John Woolley, who provided context to the dates of the polling data. Woolley explained that because they strictly use Gallup polling, and their data has become less continuous over time, that the time periods will fluctuate. Woolley also explained that the American Presidency Project uses strictly Gallup polling data because their data has been consistent for the longest period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at the bigger picture, it is important to outline significant events. For example, vaccine rollout began in December, but did not accelerate to large portions of the population until April, after Biden took office, according to BBC News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to vaccine rollout, there have been other monumental events regarding COVID that have been impactful. The Delta Variant that emerged late summer 2021 caused an immediate rise in cases, even amongst the fully vaccinated. Also, various travel bans have been put in place to help combat the spread of the virus, but they have had social and economic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting a side-by-side comparison of the patterns between COVID cases and approval ratings allows for more precise patterns to be observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Approval Rating&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-Lxh9i&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Lxh9i/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;COVID Cases&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-HklZy&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HklZy/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randi Rashkover, a voter who is a self-proclaimed close examiner of COVID news, believes that the Presidents, both Trump and Biden, are not fully to blame for the disaster of the pandemic. She believes that both Biden and Trump made mistakes and did not properly communicate with the American public. However, Trump’s efforts were much more of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trump was a rhetorical disaster,” said Rashkover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although conducting a statistical analysis on the two factors does not yield a correlation when looking at all of the data from 2020-2021, the visualization presented shows a small pattern. COVID cases have had a small impact on the approval ratings of the Presidents who have served over nearly the past two years. The political divide in the US has also played a significant role, according to Rashkover. However, whether it be Trump or Biden, people have had issues with how the pandemic has been handled since the beginning. When it comes to Trump, however, there is a stronger correlation found and is considered significant. His approval ratings show a correlation with the number of COVID cases. It is important to understand that there are other factors at play, but overall, Trump saw more of an influence on his approval ratings due to COVID than Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Women are paying more than men for similar products, and states are reaping the benefits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you head into the store, going straight to the women’s section to buy a new pair of dress pants for your upcoming job interview. You’re in desperate need of high-quality, professional slacks, but can’t afford to spend an unlimited amount. The cheapest pair you can find is $119. You reason with yourself that they’re worth the cost and head to the register to check out. As your cashier says, “That’ll be $119,” the person next to you, buying the same pair of dress pants, yet from the men’s section, is only being charged $98. You frown and wonder how you’re possibly paying more than them, but sigh and reluctantly slide your card into the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-from-2021&quot;&gt;Data from 2021&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, women pay more than men for the same products. Ranging from baby clothes and children’s toys to adult clothing to senior care items and medications, products designed for women are, on average, more expensive than those geared towards men. Based on a 2015 study conducted by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, “women’s products cost 7 percent more than similar products for men.” Since 2015, prices have increased for women’s clothing and toiletries but decreased for children’s clothing and toys and senior care items geared towards girls and women. From data collected in 2021, on average, adult clothing is $4.61 more expensive for women, and women’s toiletries cost $1.15 more than men’s. Children’s items cost $0.29 less for girls and senior care items and medicine for women has decreased in price by $0.43.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Difference in Price for Adult Clothing, Children's Clothing/Toys, Toiletries, and Senior Care Items in 2021&quot; aria-label=&quot;Grouped Bars&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-t4zFG&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/t4zFG/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;479&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-from-2015&quot;&gt;Data from 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs determined that in 2015, for children’s clothes and toys, products for girls were $1.45 more on average than those for boys. Additionally, on average, adult women paid $2.91 more for clothing, while women also paid $0.07 more for toiletries and $1.98 more for senior care items and medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Women are paying thousands of dollars more over the course of their lives to purchase similar products as men,” states the 2015 report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this article, the term “women” and products “geared towards women” are defined as those that an individual who identifies as female would purchase, not necessarily only for those who were assigned female at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Difference in Price for Adult Clothing, Children's Clothing/Toys, Toiletries, and Senior Care Items in 2015&quot; aria-label=&quot;Grouped Bars&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-bT51O&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bT51O/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;479&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the price gap is not necessarily just individual preference and societal standards of genders. The price gap comes from a structured system invisible to the ordinary consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;structures-and-substitution&quot;&gt;Structures and substitution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[C]hoices made by manufacturers and retailers result in a greater financial burden for female consumers than for male consumers,” reports the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it is not the manufacturer or retail companies that take on the responsibility of this higher price. Instead, it is the average American consumer that is forced to pay this greater number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The burden is on the female consumer as it is on women in a wide variety of issues,” says Anna Bessendorf, the author of the New York Consumer Affairs Project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf&quot;&gt;“From Cradle to Cane: The Cost of Being a Female Consumer.”&lt;/a&gt; This type of “pink tax” is still undertaken by the ordinary American consumer, resulting in a financial burden for a large portion of the United States population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the cause of gender pricing, knowledge of product substitution is essential. Overall, women’s products have fewer substitutes than men’s, meaning that they have fewer options if a brand changes the product or its size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because women are more insensitive to a price change because they don’t have close substitutes, we might expect the prices to be higher for many women’s clothing items and anything that fits that pattern,” says Mary Hansen, a professor of economics at American University in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without close substitutes, female consumers are forced to change brands or sizes and typically spend more money to have access to products that fit their body type and appeal to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you are a consumer woman and you went to X brand and you know that those jeans and that shirt fit you, probably next season somebody somewhere decided to change the cut, which usually meant you had to change your size,” says Renee Villandry, a past retail manager at Banana Republic and Loft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female consumers are then faced with the added burden of finding new brands and sizes that work for them, as well as the higher prices. “You only get price equality when stuff is perfectly substitutable for each other,” states Hansen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;population-differences&quot;&gt;Population differences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, since the initial study was conducted in New York City, it is crucial to study the gender breakdown of one of the most densely populated areas in the nation. Using data from the U.S. Census, it was found that New York City has a slightly higher percentage of women than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Percentage of US and NYC Population by Gender in 2019&quot; aria-label=&quot;Grouped Bars&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-ZccM7&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZccM7/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;313&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the national level, women make up 50.8% of the population. New York City has 1.5% more women than the national average, with a population of 4.3 million total women, making it so the higher average prices of necessary items inflict a large burden on the majority of those who live in the largest metropolitan area of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just over half of the U.S. population identifying as female and as consumers for these women-geared products, there is a significant financial burden that over half the population takes on. This pricing issue, therefore, affects a multitude of individuals, not just a small group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pay-gaps&quot;&gt;Pay gaps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is crucial to look at the payment gaps between men and women in New York City and the entire United States. New York City comprises 10 congressional districts, which are diagrammed below by combining them into New York City’s five boroughs, displaying the pay gap of men’s and women’s median earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Pay Gap in New York City for Median Earnings&quot; aria-label=&quot;Map&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-75XUY&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/75XUY/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;766&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every congressional district except for three, women earn substantially less than men, averaging a pay gap of $5,273 per year, yet is below both the state and national average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York state averages a pay gap of $8,541 based on data from the Joint Economic Committee from the United States Congress. The map below depicts the pay gaps by congressional districts of the entire state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Pay Gap in New York by Congressional District for Men's and Women's Median Earnings&quot; aria-label=&quot;Map&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-8oU8q&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8oU8q/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;611&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparatively, New York City averages a smaller pay gap, with three congressional districts where women earn on average more than men. However, in districts outside the city, the pay gap increases far beyond the state and national averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States as a whole, women’s median earnings average $9,955 per year less than men, yet they still pay higher prices for similar goods as depicted above. Pay gaps vary across states, as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Pay Gap by Median Earnings for Men and Women by State&quot; aria-label=&quot;Map&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-SOkLA&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SOkLA/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;503&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the nation, women are affected by pay gaps and higher prices. In every state, on average, women earn less than men, which greatly impacts the quality of life women can live. Yet, states reap the most benefits from the higher prices women face, especially from the taxes imposed on menstrual products, which are necessary to a menstruating consumer’s livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-pink-tax&quot;&gt;The pink tax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Period Equity, a legal organization dedicated to achieving menstruation equity, only 23 of the 50 U.S. states do not impose a tax on menstrual products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;States and &amp;quot;Pink Tax&amp;quot; Status &quot; aria-label=&quot;Map&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-ei5Q9&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ei5Q9/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;469&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than half the country imposing taxes on products necessary for a menstruator’s natural bodily function, people who menstruate are facing the financial burden that states monetarily benefit from. This tax garners thousands of dollars for the states and takes away crucial funds from menstruators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Total State Revenue from &amp;quot;Pink Tax&amp;quot; Per Capita (in billions)&quot; aria-label=&quot;Map&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-HPBZQ&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HPBZQ/3/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;483&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, states are taking vital funds away from those that need it most. Additionally, in states like North Dakota and Wyoming, pay gaps are higher and states are making more money from the pink tax, taking more funds from menstruators who already face a lower income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In areas like these, those who menstruate and/or identify as women are faced with the highest financial burden. Higher flat prices of products geared towards women and taxes imposed on necessary items for menstruators creates a consequential effect on the women’s and menstruators’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The best thing that women can really do is have awareness and choose alternatives when they’re available,” offers Bessendorf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;change-across-the-nation&quot;&gt;Change across the nation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economics, taxes, and price points govern much of an American’s life and societal values. With the data found and reported on, women are paying more than men for similar products, and states are gaining substantial revenue for this process. Those who identify as women and menstruators then face the monetary effects of these actions throughout their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, change is currently and constantly taking place across the country. In 2021 alone, Louisiana and Vermont have eliminated the pink tax and 36 pieces of legislation have been introduced in other state legislatures aimed at removing this tax, four of which are still in session, according to Period Equity. Prices on average for children’s clothing and toys geared towards girls’ and women’s senior care items have also dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If parents are buying the same toys for their boys and girls, that means the toys are increasingly substitutes and that’s exactly…the kind of place where you would see minimal price differences between target markets,” remarks Hansen, providing economic insight to the growing movement for unisex baby and children’s items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more individuals choosing to consume beyond the binary lines, therefore avoiding gender-based price barriers, society is evolving to know an economy without these implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social movements and societal acceptance of loosening the binary on consumer goods help lessen the burden of substitution on women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To the extent that social trends lead to previously gendered products really being substitutes for large portions of the population,” Hansen states, “you’re not going to see those [price] differences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By moving away from gender-based products and reducing the binary labels throughout society, we look towards a more equitable, inclusive consumer future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>For DC Restaurants, the Pandemic Persists</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thomas Marr checked his tattered leather watch. It was 6:30 p.m. on a Friday, and his pizza spot should have been filling up with hungry families, yet only a quarter of the restaurant was occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tenleytown location of Pete’s New Haven Style Pizza survived the pandemic by adapting to its customers’ safety needs and delivery demand, but months after other business sectors regained strength the restaurant has still not reached its past level of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re ready for them and we need them,” said Marr. “We’ve got the staff and supplies, but the customers just won’t come,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some return to normalcy, the DC restaurant industry currently lags far behind the national restaurant industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.dc.gov/data/vaccination&quot;&gt;80% of the city partially or fully vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, many sectors of business have almost fully returned to their 2019 levels of contribution to the district’s GDP, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local food and beverage sector is far from its past revenue, and analysis has little hope for a quick recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data recorded by the online reservation service OpenTable shows how in-person dining has changed by comparing this year’s rates to those before the pandemic. Although in-person dining is at a national low, the district remains around 30% lower than this average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Weekly Seated Diners&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-mmJWU&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mmJWU/4/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivery services have replaced much of this lost business, theorizes the reservation service. Other economic indicators, however, demonstrate that this substitute is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loan analysis company LendingTree &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lendingtree.com/business/best-places-to-open-a-restaurant/&quot;&gt;published its own analysis&lt;/a&gt; of five market metrics to predict the likelihood of restaurant recovery in major US cities, and placed Washington, DC at the very bottom of its list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its large decrease in consumer spending in restaurants, industry employment and other factors, the analysis predicts that the nation’s capital is least likely to regain its strength in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz stated that larger, more expensive cities are inherently difficult places for restaurants to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The sheer amount of restaurant options that are available in those areas plays a big role,” said Schulz. “That’s true even in the best of times. Factor in a pandemic, and it all just gets exponentially more difficult,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many national attempts to preserve the food and beverage sector have proved to be lifelines for restaurants in the district. The Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Fund gave nearly a billion dollars to restaurants, bars, and food counters in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Restaurant Revitalization Fund Grant Recipients&quot; aria-label=&quot;Map&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-3aYBU&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3aYBU/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;731&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money from the RRF, a subsidiary of the Small Business Administration, does not need to be paid back. The funds can be used for payroll, rent and other business expenses until March of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“RRF money was a saving grace,” said manager Ben Noval as he motioned to the outdoor seating the funds helped purchase at his Dupont Circle restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noval was forced to lay off 14 of his colleagues and close friends at the outset of the pandemic and has only been able to hire back eight of them. To date, the pandemic has caused over 30,000 job losses in Washington restaurants, according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can barely keep up with the little business that we’re getting,” said Noval. “Now is the time that we need more staff, and now is the time that we need more funding,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Restaurant Association has been extensively campaigning for more federal money to be put into the RRF and redistributed before the end of the year. Little movement in congress has been caused by the requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locally, the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington has been providing relief to laid off industry workers through a donation based fund. With no financial ability to help entire restaurants, RAMW supports the National Restaurant Association’s advocacy and tries to increase the sense of community between restaurants in the district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense of community is what both Marr and Noval believe has kept the industry alive throughout the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Restaurants, especially those owned by minorities, are very connected to one another,” said Noval. “Competition is very real, of course, but we’re all in this together,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flourish-embed flourish-chart&quot; data-src=&quot;visualisation/8039961&quot;&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington restaurants that received RRF grants had one of the highest percentages of female-owned restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationally, restaurants employ more minority managers than any other industry, according to the National Restaurant Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These minority-owned restaurants unofficially banded together during the pandemic to help one another, reported restaurant workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Little Ethiopia’ on U and 9th street has become a culinary hotspot for all Washington residents and witnessed this community action first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurants of the Shaw corner were hit hard by the pandemic, forcing many to close their doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaleb Tswafe moved to Washington from Ethiopia several years ago and began chasing memories from home in the kitchens of the area. He quickly learned to love Little Ethiopia, and was distraught when the pandemic forced many restaurants to close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can see people running produce across the street to their competition,” Tswafe said. “That’s something you’ll only get between two Ethiopian restaurants and that’s the way out of this mess,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost none of these restaurants received any federal loans or grants, and have relied on their communities for relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a problem affecting all the restaurants here and we’ve gotta fix it,” said Tswafe. “We’re not far from healed but we’ll get there together,”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The World’s Largest MLM has Given Millions to Republicans to Restrict the Rights of Their Sellers</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Pain is temporary, but your dreams are going to last forever if you let them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is Adrian Mitchell’s self-described credo that he aspires to live by for the rest of his life; however, just two years ago, this was the furthest thing from his mind. After silently struggling with his mental health throughout his youth, Adrian decided to drop out of college in 2018 and seek professional help. Although things were somewhat better after seeing a psychologist and returning home, Adrian’s life took another twist when he was diagnosed with MS. “I just kept fighting in the hopes that I could reach out and grab that light at the end of the tunnel,” Adrian said. But he didn’t grab the light. One day as he was scrolling through Instagram, a friend from college direct messaged Adrian with a proposal that he says, “saved my life.” Adrian had received an offer to join Monat, a billion-dollar shampoo and wellness company, as a “Market Partner.” With the promise of “being his own boss” and “living life on his own terms,” all Adrian had to do was pay $200 recruitment fee and he would receive personalized training, a variety of company products, and a fresh start. The light grabbed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-dream-with-some-strings-attached&quot;&gt;A Dream With Some Strings Attached&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monat is a Multi-level Marketing (MLM) company, a type of business that is primarily predicated on independent sellers who sell product and recruit more sellers. While Monat’s social media account and website present the vouge-like appearance and lavish looking products one would come to expect of a modern beauty company, their business model could not be more different. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dsa.org/statistics-insights/factsheets&quot;&gt;billions of dollars in sales&lt;/a&gt; across the US, powerful MLMs like Monat wield an incredible amount of power over their sellers and the governmental regulations that they abide by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Adrian believes that he has had a “personal rebirth” due to his newfound purpose and community he developed throughout his year-long tenure selling for Monat, his experience is  not reflective of all newly initiated Market Partners. Gemma Miller, an ex-seller for Monat, talked with me about her vastly differing experience working for Monat. “They didn’t treat me like I was even human,” Gemma recounted as she looked back upon her time within the company. Gemma estimates that she lost thousands of dollars selling for Monat because of the “constant pressure from leadership” to buy more products to advertise on her social media. Furthermore, Gemma described the social isolation she felt after having tried to “rope everyone I knew” into the business just as her uplines had told her to do. Compared to the typical door-knocking MLM selling of the past, Monat’s business is conducted exclusively through social media, with their sellers posing as quasi-influencers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although MLMs have different internal structures, they all share a rank system by which sellers can “rank-up” to different tiers by achieving a targeted goal of sales and recruits. While MLMs have often been compared to pyramid schemes due to the high monetary incentive to recruit others, they are currently legal under US law and were reported to have made upwards of $40 billion in sales &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dsa.org/statistics-insights/factsheets&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) nonetheless harshly advises against joining an MLM due to their financially disparate results. A study conducted by the FTC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/trade-regulation-rule-disclosure-requirements-and-prohibitions-concerning-business-opportunities-ftc.r511993-00008%C2%A0/00008-57281.pdf.&quot;&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the income breakdowns of more than 30 MLMs and found that nearly 99.6% of sellers in an MLM lose money. Although masses of publicly available studies that share similar findings should reasonably ward off anyone from joining an MLM, the Direct Selling Association (DSA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dsa.org/statistics-insights/factsheets&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that there are nearly 8 million “direct sellers” currently operating in the US. While the DSA operates on behalf of almost all prominent MLMs, their privately collected data should not be readily ignored. Because most MLMs keep their financial data relatively close to their chest, it is difficult to accurately quantify their business operations. However, Amway, which brought in $8.5 billion in revenue in 2020 and is often credited as the world’s largest MLM, has droves of publicly available data from a surprisingly obvious source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1990, Amway has made over $20 million dollars in political donations to politicians and campaigns through their holding company, Alticor. Because all political donations are legally required to be accessible by the public, every recipient of Alticor’s donations can be viewed on the Federal Elections Committee’s (FEC) website. Due to a lack of any internal data from prominent MLMs, their political donations and lobbied bills can glean some insight as to what governmental changes they wish to see in relation to sellers like Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amway-and-the-republican-party&quot;&gt;Amway and the Republican Party&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amway has heavily supported the Republican party according to an analysis of two decades worth of political donations. More specifically, over 99% of their political donations have gone towards Republican campaigns and advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Alticor/Amway Donations Since 2012&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-nhfNV&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nhfNV/4/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow=e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not a new revelation. Alticor’s relationship with the Republican party has been strong for almost two decades. One month before the November 1994 elections, Alticor donated nearly $2.5 million dollars to the GOP, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/she-did-it-amway/&quot;&gt;largest political donation in history&lt;/a&gt; for a single election at one time. Following the GOP sweep in 1994, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was personally honored by future Senate President and Republican Nominee Bob Dole at a lavish fundraising event. Since 2012, Alticor’s top recipient of funds has been the Republican National Committee, followed by other Republican and conservative-leaning groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Top 5 Recipients of Alitcor Donations&quot; aria-label=&quot;Stacked Column Chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-cclOQ&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cclOQ/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the massive amount of money poured into national Republican groups, Alticor has donated nearly $850,000 to the Michigan Republican Party, the state where their headquarters reside. Not including the massive contribution to Dick DeVos’ bid for the governor of Michigan, the DeVos personal donations also align quite heavily with that of Alticor as well, marking another visible trend in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;DeVos Family Donations Since 1996&quot; aria-label=&quot;Pie Chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-lH0Nf&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lH0Nf/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;582&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following their largest year of political spending in 2016, Betsey DeVos, daughter-in-law of Richard DeVos and husband of former Amway president Dick DeVos, was nominated by President Trump to serve as his Secretary of Education. While it is obvious that there is a link between the most powerful MLM and the Republican party, following money trail can give insight as to why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-money-trail&quot;&gt;The Money Trail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their political donations, Alticor also engages in a substantial amount of lobbying every year. By looking at the specific bills that Alticor has put hundreds of thousands of dollars towards, some insight can be gained as to how they view their employees and products. Edgar Vasquez, an analyst for the lobbying firm Invariant told me “Companies like Alticor often hire people like us to act as ‘middlemen’ with lawmakers” to advocate on behalf of policies that they see as being advantageous. Spending roughly $500,000 dollars a year on lobbying, Alticor has continually pushed legislation to deem their sellers as “independent contractors” as opposed to employees. Recently, Alticor lobbied the &lt;em&gt;New GIG Act of 2019&lt;/em&gt;, alongside other companies such as Uber and Lyft. Introduced by Congressman Tom Rice, a recipient of Alticor money, the &lt;em&gt;NEW Gig Act of 2019&lt;/em&gt;, produces a legal statute that would restrict millions of employees from gaining many benefits were they to be labeled as independent contractors. Because the Affordable Care Act (ACA) imposes a hefty penalty on businesses over fifty employees that do not provide healthcare to at least 95% their employees, the nomenclature change to “independent contractor” subverts this fine. Additionally, independent contractors are not included within minimum wage requirements, federal discrimination laws, and labor regulations, leaving them with virtually no government protection. While an argument can be made that MLM sellers should classify as independent contractors, the protections that this status affords them severely limits their financial options. Although sellers should do their due diligence regarding their employers, vulnerable individuals can fall prey to these companies with little recourse should they fall into the 99% of people who lose money within an MLM. Adrian, who continues to struggle with his mental health and MS, is about to turn twenty-six, the age when he is no longer eligible to be covered under his mother’s health insurance. While Alticor and other prominent MLMs lobby millions of dollars to label their employees as independent contractors, Adrian is trying to find a way to pay for his future medical bills without the help of his employer. Because the Republican party has so often declared itself as the “party of small government” and resented intrusive business regulation, the lack of protections for independent contractors within MLMs makes it nearly impossible for struggling sellers to “pull themselves up by their bootstraps.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although numerous Congressmembers have received donations from Alticor, there are currently thirteen house members and twelve senators in Congress that have both received money from Alticor and introduced a bill that the MLM has lobbied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Current Congressional Members Supported by Alticor*&quot; aria-label=&quot;Table&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-UxOOs&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UxOOs/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;878&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some could write off these donations as being purely coincidental, Tim Walberg and Marsha Blackburn stand out as being the top two recipients of Alticor money. Unsurprisingly, both members played a role in the Congressional Direct Selling Caucus, a group of Congressmembers who advocate on behalf of MLM sellers and executives. Blackburn, the founder of the caucus has since left due to her election to the Senate, while Walberg continues to serve in the coalition. Amway wields a tremendous amount of power as the world’s largest MLM, and it is the duty of consumers, sellers, and politicians to recognize these schemes and curb their influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;persevering-through-the-pain&quot;&gt;Persevering Through the Pain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Republican and Democrat parties have been ideologically separated for decades regarding the proper extent of business regulations, the unchecked power and overwhelmingly harmful impacts of MLMs should be a sign to Republicans that their tactics are not working. But partisan bickering means nothing to sellers like Adrian. When asked about the future medical expenses that he will have to pay without the help of his employers, Adrian once again repeated his moto. “Pain is temporary, but your dreams are going to last forever if you let them.” While he is still at the first rank of Monat, Adrian nonetheless pursues his dream of helping others, hoping that his pain is indeed temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Pandemic Mental Health Crisis: How the world is healing after a year of struggle</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;mental-health-what-happened&quot;&gt;Mental Health: What happened?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost 20 months of the Coronavirus pandemic ravaging through the United States, the long term effects of isolation have become abundantly clear–particularly as people strive to achieve a sense of “normalcy.” Though the global health effects have long been discussed, the individual, less-publicized effects are equally worth studying, particularly when they can cause damage in one’s body, and their mind.
As the Covid-19 pandemic took over the United States, consuming our lives, so did mental health issues. More specifically, anxiety and depression–two of the most common mental illnesses in the US (&lt;em&gt;National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;). Studies about these disorders can enlighten us when it comes to the impact that the pandemic has had on mental health. In a study by the &lt;strong&gt;National Center for Health Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; symptoms were quantified using a scale, and measured over the course of 7-days by adults all around the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Throughout 2020 &quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-A4In3&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/A4In3/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;anxiety-and-depression&quot;&gt;Anxiety and Depression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, the month with the &lt;strong&gt;highest percentage of anxiety and depression symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; during the year of 2020 was &lt;strong&gt;December.&lt;/strong&gt; This aligns with the start of an upward trend in Covid cases and hospitalizations during the month, which led to stricter regulations and an increased lockdown. In fact, as the year went on, mental health fluctuated very much in conjunction with the amount of covid cases. As restrictions began to be lifted in April, there was a sharp decrease in the average number of symptoms, but as cases rose and restrictions did too, there were evident increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-collegiate-impact&quot;&gt;The collegiate impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic first hit in March of 2020 and students were sent home from schools and universities, isolation began. This was particularly difficult for college students and young adults, &lt;strong&gt;ages 18-29&lt;/strong&gt;; students were forcibly removed from their social lives, going back to living in their childhood bedrooms and having limited outside contact. As these challenges faced the country, colleges suddenly had to adapt to a growing number of mental health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Symptoms of Mental Health by Age in 2020&quot; aria-label=&quot;Column Chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-nPqVJ&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nPqVJ/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;208&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;American University&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Washington DC,&lt;/strong&gt; the counseling center became inundated with requests for telehealth appointments, and these requests only increased as the year went on.
&lt;strong&gt;Jacqueline Darby, Director of Clinical Services at the AU Counseling Center&lt;/strong&gt; acknowledges that this pandemic has brought to light the importance of mental health awareness. “I think COVID-19 has brought to people’s attention the importance of taking care of their mental health,” she says. “COVID-19 was and still is a hard time for everyone and it makes sense that individuals need support in processing all that occurred during 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the pandemic, the AU Counseling Center has seen an &lt;strong&gt;increase in counseling appointments,&lt;/strong&gt; given partially because this year, more students are able to access the counseling services. “Last year, we were limited by licensure requirements, and we could only see students who were physically located in DC, Maryland or Virginia. Now, with students being back on campus more people can use our services.” This increase in services has been a remarkable help for the AU community, largely encouraging the use of mental health resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Renee Gopon, an American University sophomore, she felt that her mental health was definitely impacted by the challenges of online school, especially at the outset of the pandemic in March. “Looking at a screen all day, on top of countless students being at home, affected students’ ability to be enthusiastic about their studies, which for me impacted my grades.” When students are faced with these challenges, it becomes harder to tend to mental health, as Gopon mentions. “There were so many factors that impacted mental health because of the pandemic and I think that the circumstances of quarantine made it difficult for anyone to thrive in an emotional mental capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;international-perspective&quot;&gt;International Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For international students at American University and beyond, mental health challenges are augmented due to time differences, online classes, and simply the transition of living in a new country. Eric Rafael Torija Mosquera is from Luxembourg, and carried out his Covid-19 quarantine from his home in Europe. “As an international student, there are a lot of mental health challenges,” he says, in regards to the 2020 pandemic. “During my experience online during the lockdown of fall 2020, very little was done to accommodate the needs of internationals.”
Mosquera mentioned the late registration times for classes, lack of accommodations for time differences, and difficulty in building a sense of community. “You and your friends all have so much to do, which makes it harder to make meaningful friendships which decrease mental health,” he says, noting the importance of friendship to his own mental health. “My friends get me through any mental health challenge that comes up. If you have a community, you’re surviving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forming-community&quot;&gt;Forming Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But international students are not the only ones who feel that a sense of belonging during tough times can improve mental health. Adam Hussaini, an AU sophomore studying Political Science, remarked that the lack of community has worsened his mental health. “I think more of an on-campus community is vital to feeling a part of something. You need to find your identity as an AU student, and with a stronger community–especially during the pandemic–this would help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an increase in workload as he moves through sophomore year, Hussaini wonders how the AU community is working to better support the student’s mental health.”Challenge Accepted is trying to have us take on challenges,” he says, “but &lt;strong&gt;how are we supposed to do that when we are already challenged with our mental health and the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt; How are we to take on more challenges when we are set back with mental health problems?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dc-data&quot;&gt;DC Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While American University feels the weight of mental health struggles, so does the DC community at large. In terms of which mental health services were most requested over the past year, community support and therapy stay close to the top of the list. This is unsurprising, given the need for community mental health resources during a pandemic, as well as increased therapy appointments for individuals needing to discuss their unique concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;January 2021 DC Behavioral Health Report(Oct 1, 2019-Sept 30, 2020)&quot; aria-label=&quot;Bar Chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-AM8cT&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AM8cT/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;428&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to DMV native Hope Lockwood, she strongly believes that isolation, specifically back in the heart of the pandemic, is what has led to this need for greater services. “I think a lot of people have felt isolated (during the pandemic) which has caused a deterioration in overall mental health,” she says. Hope is not alone in this belief–when surveyed, AU students overwhelmingly agreed that they have felt the impacts of isolation personally, leading to an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in the US &quot; aria-label=&quot;Map&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-yPwtb&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yPwtb/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;525&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the entire US saw the impact of anxiety and depression rates climbing throughout Covid-19. Though the entire US was hit hard, &lt;strong&gt;Louisiana, Nevada, and Mississippi&lt;/strong&gt; were hit the hardest specifically by anxiety and depression symptoms. For these states particularly, mental health resources are more than necessary. For every state, though, &lt;strong&gt;a greater awareness of mental health issues is necessary&lt;/strong&gt; in order for us to thrive during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How green is the grass on the Friedham Quad?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;American University in Washington, D.C. was the first university in America to achieve carbon neutrality, yet this distinction has faced some questioning in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aus-sustainability-journey&quot;&gt;AU’s sustainability journey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, AU joined 500 other American colleges and universities by signing onto the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment to address the looming threat of climate change. The next year, the University created its Office of Sustainability to promote sustainable living and service, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.american.edu/about/sustainability/milestones.cfm&quot;&gt;AU’s Sustainability website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over that past 10 years, AU installed a solar hot water system, its first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified Building, the creation of a fossil-free fund and its first sustainability plan, among other sustainability achievements, according to the Sustainability website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sustainability plan for the University was created in 2010, as well as the Zero Waste Policy. During that same year, AU established its goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2020—a goal it reached two years prior in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Second Nature, an organization that manages the &lt;a href=&quot;https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/network/&quot;&gt;Presidents’ Climate Leadership Commitments and the Climate Leadership Network&lt;/a&gt;, carbon neutrality is defined as “having no net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;achieving-the-carbon-neutrality-title&quot;&gt;Achieving the carbon neutrality title&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways in which these emissions are reduced: eliminating net GHG emissions and or the minimization of GHG emissions. This process includes purchasing “carbon offsets or other measures to mitigate the remaining emissions,” according to Second Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these mitigation efforts is achieved through the purchase of renewable energy credits (RECs). According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/repowertoolbox/renewable-energy-certificate-monetization&quot;&gt;Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/a&gt;, RECs are defined as “tradeable, market-based instrument(s) that represent the legal property rights to the ‘renewable-ness.” In other words, this allows AU to offset what the campus emits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process for determining emissions falls into three categories: Scope 1: emissions directly from campus, Scope 2: purchased electricity and Scope 3: indirect emissions, or everything that doesn’t fall directly into Scope 1 and 2, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.american.edu/about/sustainability/tracking-progress.cfm&quot;&gt;AU’s tracking process&lt;/a&gt;. The reduction or elimination of these categories leads to carbon neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in recent times, this title has come under scrutiny as AU cannot physically be carbon neutral, but rather, gains its neutrality through purchasing RECs and external efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emissions-growth-over-time&quot;&gt;Emissions growth over time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2004, the total combustion and emissions of the University rose by almost 6%. According to the EPA, the process for RECs works so that for every emission output, the buyer needs to increase the RECs to match, or buy more RECs to exceed the emission output. So, as AU increases its emissions, they also increase their purchase of RECs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;AU Emissions and RECs, 2004-2019&quot; aria-label=&quot;Split Bars&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-8i5qE&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8i5qE/4/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;445&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AU uses its carbon neutrality status in its branding, marketing and admissions campaigns. However, AU is carbon neutral on paper, rather than through physical practice. Instead of expanding and investing in on-campus resources, like solar panels, wind generation and other renewable energy methods, the University invested in a solar farm in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-au-got-the-title&quot;&gt;How AU got the title&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tacy Lambiase is the Sustainability Manager at AU’s Office of Sustainability. Among other things, she is one of many who oversee the sustainability agenda of the University and the community outreach of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collection process to calculate the emissions includes an institutional survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do an annual inventory every year. To collect data, we calculate faculty, staff and students’ emissions across campus. A portion of our community gets surveyed every year,” Lambiase said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the Office of Institutional Research calculates the percentages needed to survey the community, as well as the estimated target response rate for the community, Lambiase said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey consists of a list of questions regarding personal emissions. For example, transportation needs like commute time or plane mileage for study abroad are questions in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are able to get a pretty good sense of how our community is emitting, and the implications related to that,” Lambiase said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become carbon neutral, the University needs to produce enough renewable energy or purchase offsets to achieve neutrality. There needs to be enough of these resources to exceed, or match, the campus carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple strategies used to achieve neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The first is to reduce emissions as much as possible. The second is changing the sources of fuel on campus, like the University’s switch from steam to low temperature hot water,” Lambiase said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last method of zero net emissions includes a monetary investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And the third is investing in 100% renewable energy,” Lambiase said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget for the purchases of RECs comes from the Facilities Management budget, according to Lambiase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AU has to rely on such external methods for carbon neutrality investment due to limited campus space. In other words, AU does not have the physical space to provide solar and wind resources to overcome the campus electricity and power needs, Lambiase said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since AU is an urban campus and doesn’t have the space to build entire farms, they built an off-campus solar farm in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wjla.com/news/local/george-washington-university-american-university-make-deal-to-buy-solar-power-farms--104425&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. The entire farm contains a quarter of a million solar panels, but the output of these meets only 50% of the campus electricity needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The energy that is generated by those solar panels is going to the local North Carolina grid. The energy goes to those communities…they are not directly traveling to D.C.,” Lambiase said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these solar and wind farms, RECs are purchased to help offset the energy coming from D.C.’s energy grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this investment also includes on-campus renewables, such as the solar panels on 10 of AU’s rooftops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are looking to expand that,” Lambiase said. 
It’s important to note that, despite the 2,500 panels located across campus, it only covers half of a percent of the campus needs, Lambiase said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon neutrality comes from this plethora of emission resources and solutions. However, it does not allow AU to hold the most carbon-neutral school in America. AU has not claimed such a title but holds the “first large campus and the first university to become carbon neutral,” according to Second Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes some students skeptical of AU’s sustainability commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some students are concerned with the greenwash effect. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp&quot;&gt;Greenwashing&lt;/a&gt; is the phenomenon or the practice of “making unwarranted or overblown claims of sustainability or environmental friendliness in an attempt to gain market share,” according to Environmental Health Perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-au-measure-up-in-the-us&quot;&gt;How does AU measure up in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2018, the EPA archives the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/green-power-partnership-top-30-college-university-pdfs&quot;&gt;top 30&lt;/a&gt; carbon neutral colleges in America, on an almost quarterly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;AU ranking in Top 30 Green Schools, 2018-2021&quot; aria-label=&quot;Column Chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-klc6w&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/klc6w/2/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the EPA, while AU is in the top 30 carbon-neutral colleges, it has never come in first place, nor the top 10. Most recently, AU ranked last in the list of top 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While AU has become carbon neutral, the school does not measure up to other schools in America in terms of green power usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-of-sustainability-at-au&quot;&gt;Future of sustainability at AU&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Cross is the University’s Zero Waste Manager. He oversees the campus recycling process and works to implement community outreach. He’s witnessed the evolution of campus sustainability as a student and now a staff member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was a really big push around 2018…with the three bins,” Cross said in an interview. “We work with a partner facility, Prince George’s County Composting Facility, for composting. We can’t send any contaminates,” Cross said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where student volunteers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.american.edu/about/sustainability/get-involved/ecorep-program.cfm&quot;&gt;EcoReps&lt;/a&gt;, come in. One job of the volunteers is to check and sort bags for possible contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking past the last few years, AU has plans to become completely zero waste by 2030—a step that requires “all work on all ends,” Cross said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimi Beckemeier is an Environmental Studies and Computer Science major, and volunteers at the Office of Sustainability as an EcoRep. Her line of work includes sustainable volunteering, working with 4Ocean, and updating her sustainability blog with resources for the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“AU is doing a good job of improving… sustainable living, however, there is always room for improvement. There is a plan in the works for this already, but the biggest thing I would say is to get rid of single-use plastics in our dining halls,” Beckemeier said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-many-universities-are-in-the-us-and-why-that-number-is-changing&quot;&gt;U.S. News&lt;/a&gt;, there are 3,982 colleges in America. By looking at AU’s commitment to environmental sustainability, they rank higher than the majority of colleges and universities in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commitment to the environment can be seen in a variety of environmental science and sustainability programs as well as clubs, and even in the Office of Sustainability. To that end, many students also share this commitment to greater environmental justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aside from individual actions such as eating less meat, thrifting…there is an abundance of programs, resources and people willing to help students turn sustainable,” Beckemeier said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beckemeier acknowledges that while AU has employed many tactics in overcoming carbon emissions, there are areas that could use improvements, such as plastic-free lunches, farmers’ markets and outdoor events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It looks like more environmental organizations, environmental legislation, and more environmental education,” Beckemeier said.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Good for Goodreads: Reading Grows in Popularity amid COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;She sat in her room, and watched the pile of books grow larger, week after week of remaining stuck in the house. Reading was everything, it was her way of maintaining a routine and keeping sane amidst unprecedented times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Murphy, 20, a junior attending The College of New Jersey, has always considered herself an avid reader, and staying in her house in her small town of Harrington Park during the spring of 2020 and the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, she found immense comfort in one of her oldest interestsÑlosing herself in a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obviously quarantine was an incredibly difficult and stressful time for most people,” Murphy said, nodding to her friend casually sitting beside her. “I found myself reading frequently as a way to manage everything going on in the world and keep things from feeling too overwhelming.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many others, Ryan Murphy supplemented her reading with Goodreads, the worldÕs largest site for readers and book recommendations, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/about/us&quot;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;. Goodreads allows its users to review, rate, and recommend books, all while connecting with their peers. The rating feature is what is most attractive to users, according to Murphy, as they can rate books from one to five. Along with that, they can write their own review, and then view and comment on other users reviews as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically during the height of quarantine in March and April, Goodreads users had a hugely positive spike, gaining around 105,000 users in April 2020 alone, according to data from a sample of Goodreads users put into a Global Book Reading Dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Goodreads users 2019 vs 2020&quot; aria-label=&quot;Interactive line chart&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-s2OV2&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/s2OV2/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rating feature is what is most attractive to users, according to Murphy, as they have the opportunity to rate books from one to five. Along with that, they can write their own review, and then view and comment on other users reviews as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rating books is the best part of Goodreads,” Murphy exclaimed. She pulled up her Goodreads and scrolled though, showing off the numerous books she has rated, ranging across multiple different genres. “ItÕs a huge motivator to finish a book, especially since I know that I can see what people say and they can see what I write.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books like the Harry Potter series, The Hunger Games, and Twilight, have amassed some of the most user reviews, with all of them obtaining around 40,000 reviews, according to a dataset of Goodreads user rating data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodreads has had a strong presence for years, but more people were attracted to it as the pandemic grew in severity. Sofia Brockman, 20, a student at American University, considered herself a big reader earlier in her life, but as she got older, she found herself gravitating towards other hobbies, therefore reading less and less. She had heard about Goodreads in July of 2021 and found the idea of a social platform for reading very appealing, according to Brockman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was attracted to the idea of sharing my thoughts and being able to find friends and discuss books with them on this platform,” Brockman said. “ItÕs like a really big book club, and the sense of community is really comforting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brockman excitedly explained the features of Goodreads she enjoyed the most, specifically the reading challenge. The Goodreads yearly reading challenge allows users to create a goal for themselves and participate with their friends. The social aspect of Goodreads allows for users to join groups, ranging from science fiction to Taylor Swift Lyrics that relate to books, according to Brockman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Brockman, Kelli Pastor, 51, from Layton New Jersey, had not heard of Goodreads until relatively recently. She has been reading for most of her life and has been a member of multiple different book clubs, one of which was focused entirely on reading and analyzing War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I first heard of Goodreads when I went to my local bookstore,” Pastor said. There was a display table featuring “BookTok favorites” and “Goodreads Discussion Starters” and upon seeing she went home and looked up those unfamiliar terms, according to Pastor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Social Media and reading were never intertwined in my mind,” Pastor exclaimed. “It is such a foreign concept to me, but I feel that it will be very beneficial in re-engaging readers, especially those of a younger generation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With COVID-19, more and more people spent time inside, and like Brockman, they had the free time to discover new interests. There was a rise in social media presence, with TikTok in particularly experiencing massive growth. TikTok appealed to so many different groups of people, as everyone can find a niche to express themselves, according to Brockman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imogen Angel, 19, a sophomore at American University, became familiar with Goodreads through TikTok Ñshe created an account after receiving many book recommendations via TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BookTok, a sect of TikTok, emerged in during COVID, and was an important factor in the growth of Goodreads, according to Angel. “BookTokers,” as the influencers who grew from promoting books, have been called, would use Goodreads to connect with their followers, encouraging them to join the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I ultimately made the account in order to follow the reviews of the influencers I found on TikTok,Ó Angel exclaimed. ÒThey created groups on Goodreads for their followers to join, and the book recommendations have been amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Angel, reading is an important form of expression, like those across the world who joined Goodreads during the pandemic. From February 2020 to September 2020, Goodreads had users join from 229 different countries, spanning each continent, with Antarctica being the exception, according to a dataset of a sample of Goodreads users that joined the site during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same period, 48.8 percent of users that joined were female, with 38.7 percent being male and 12.4 percent not identifying within that binary according to that same dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Goodreads Users Who Joined During the PandemicÊ&quot; aria-label=&quot;Map&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-chart-n7Alh&quot; src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n7Alh/1/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;&quot; height=&quot;380&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var a in e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r&lt;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][a]+&quot;px&quot;}}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodreads reaches and attracts such a large group, according to Angel. The app is an ever-growing community that continues to evolve and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Murphy, Goodreads provides an excitement that reading has not had for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is so much potential for the future of Goodreads,Ó Murphy said. ÒI canÕt wait to keep reading and finding others who share my passion.”&lt;/p&gt;
