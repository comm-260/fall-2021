Data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention shows trends in symptoms of anxiety among the age group between 2019 to 2020.</p> <p>The stress of maintaining a stellar academic standing, a social life, and an internship or job, among other potential time vacuums, can contribute to feelings of sadness, emptiness, and irritability, all of which were exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic. The vast majority of college students were forced off-campus in March 2020 and made the jarring shift from in-person to online classes.</p> <p>For the first time since the great depression, a majority of 52% of young adults lived with one or both of their parents in 2020. For students like myself, this living situation was not chosen, it was forced on us. An inability to socialize with friends and participate in the opportunities offered by college life contributed to a rise in mental health issues for many students.</p> <p>For Olivia Alafriz, a sophomore in the School of Communications, living at home was an isolating experience.</p> <p>“Being inside all the time negatively affected my mood because the lockdown prevented me from seeing my friends. I had no real social interactions for over five months and it was hard not to feel a bit depressed,”” she said.</p> <p>Adding to her worries was her fear of infecting her immunocompromised grandmother, whom she lived with throughout the year. She said she met almost all of her current friends at American through classes this fall and was unable not make many social connections in Zoom classes.</p> <p>An annual University of Michigan mental health study found that 66% of undergraduate and graduate respondents reported feelings of isolation from others. Social distancing meant students were already at a physical distance from each other, and for most colleges that did reopen in the Fall of 2020, any large social gatherings were strictly prohibited. This made attending college a sometimes even more isolating experience than staying at home.</p> <p>Ethan Dumas, a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island said, “I spent my freshman year on campus but because of the strict social distancing guidelines the only times when I left my dorm room were for meals or exercise. At least at home, I had my dad’s cooking to look forward to every day.”</p> <p>A side-by-side analysis of data on 18-29-year-olds reporting symptoms of anxiety in 2019 and 18-34-year-olds reporting symptoms of anxiety in 2020 shows a dramatic increase in those reporting symptoms after the onset of the pandemic. The data collected by the CDC shows rates of anxiety started at 13.9% in January of 2019 and ended at 13% in December. By May 2020, three months after the first lockdown period began in March, symptoms had increased by a massive 27 points, climbing up to 40%.</p> <iframe title="18-29 Year Olds Reporting Symptoms of Anxiety" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-na5cG" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/na5cG/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <iframe title="COVID-19 Deaths by Month in 2020" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-p3Ytd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/p3Ytd/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <p>The two spikes in symptoms of anxiety in 2020 occurred in the middle of Summer, at 46.2%, and in the middle of Autumn, at 50.2% in November. These spikes may correlate to a rise in deaths associated with the virus, which are tracked by month in the chart below. Over the Summer, the second-highest number of deaths reported occurred over July at 31,118 lives lost. Similarly, in the Fall deaths more than doubled from October to November, climbing to 53,223.</p> <iframe title="18-34-Year-Olds Reporting Symptoms of Anxiety in 2019" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TClcW" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TClcW/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script> <p>The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election provided another possible source of distress for young adults in November. According to a study by the American Psychological Association in October, around two-thirds of all adults (68%) said the election was a significant source of stress in their lives (APA).</p> <p>For Zahra Deshaw, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, living at home proved incredibly draining and worsened the mental health issues she already struggles with.</p> <p>“It was really bad because I already have mental health problems and my siblings also have issues so it was hard for my Dad to manage all of our problems at once,” she said.</p> <p>Zahra is biracial, identifying as white and Bengali. She said living with her white father during the pandemic as the only queer brown woman in the household caused immense stress.</p> <p>“I’m the only queer person in the family and we lived with our white Dad so that made things even more complicated because we were having all these tough conversations about race with a white person. This made me even more depressed because I didn’t have a brown person to talk with, which made me feel isolated,” she said.</p> <p>Zahra is referring to the cultural reckoning with police brutality and racism which occurred over the Summer of 2020. She lived in Portland, OR, one of the epicenters for protests over police brutality, which often turned violent, and she said she struggled with her desire to be part of the movement and her fear of being infected. Ultimately, Zahra decided to attend the protests but said she was extra cautious about social distancing and wearing a mask.</p> <p>According to the Chair of the Psychology Department, Professor Ahrens, “Being a member of an underrepresented group, being queer, in a lot of circles is going to be a chronic stress and if you think about the effects of the additional chronic stress of the pandemic on people who already have chronic stress, you would anticipate that the effects would be stronger.”</p> <p>Due to the intersectional systems of oppression queer women of color like Zahra experience, the addition of a new isolating condition to her life posed unique challenges to her mental health. Challenges that she has said have mostly subsided now that she is supported by a network of queer friends in DC.</p> <p>“The adjustment period for me going from living at home to moving to DC was brief because of how much happier I am living on my own than under my Dad’s roof. I no longer have to walk him through the everyday macroaggressions he subjected me to, whether intentional or not, and that has made all the difference,” she said.</p> <p>When I asked Professor Ahrens for a general assessment of how students mental health levels have changed now that they are back to in-person classes he said, “I’ve certainly heard from many students who just have been so grateful to be back and to see people in person, and it’s, by their reports, made a huge difference. Every student’s experience is different but in general, I see positive trends.”</p> <p>There is a distinct correlation between a rise in symptoms of depression and anxiety among 18 to 29 year old’s and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As gathered by my data and interviews, college students specifically experienced worsening mental health due to a switch from in-person to online classes, an inability to socialize with friends, and the feelings of isolation brought on by the first lockdown. The contentious 2020 U.S. presidential election also raised levels of anxiety among young adults.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="previous" href="/fall-2021/vinyl/">The Vinyl Record Renaissance &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/fall-2021/images/anxiety.png" alt="The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a rise in anxiety among young adults"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/vinyl/">The Vinyl Record Renaissance</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/screen-time-children/">The Effects of Increasing Screen Time on Children</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2021/presidential-approval-covid-19/">Presidential Approval Ratings: How much of a role does COVID play in the public’s opinion of the chief executive?</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Dec 2021</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/fall-2021/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
