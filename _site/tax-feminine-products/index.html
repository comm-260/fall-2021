It’s time we talk about the tampon tax.</p> <p><strong>Financials</strong></p> <p>Apart from the irrationally high cost, feminine hygiene products have an added tax, called the tampon tax, that takes away one to two dollars annually from an individual women’s earning in 27 states. Coincidentally, the states that charge women more for menstrual products are also the states in which women earn significantly less.</p> <iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/8060626/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" class="flourish-embed-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:600px;" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe> <div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8060626/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/8060626" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;" /> </a></div> <iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/8013087/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" class="flourish-embed-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:600px;" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe> <div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8013087/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/8013087" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;" /> </a></div> <p>The darker pink shading on the map on the left shows the higher rates of tampon tax. These coincide with the lighter green shading in the map on the right showing lower overall annual women’s earnings.</p> <p>Women are expected to pay higher taxes on products specifically made for them in some states even though they are paid less. But is a dollar or two really worth fighting for?</p> <p>According to co-founder of <a href="https://www.periodequity.org/">Period Equity</a> Laura Strausfeld, though the numbers seem small, they do add up. On average women spend about <a href="https://swnsdigital.com/us/2019/11/new-research-reveals-how-much-the-average-woman-spends-per-month-on-menstrual-products/">159 dollars a year</a> just on period products.</p> <p>Strausfeld believes that the key to bringing down economic barriers for people who menstruate and need these products is for everybody, especially those who don’t menstruate to understand the nature of menstruation. The most effective way to do that: by openly talking about menstruation.</p> <p><strong>Social</strong></p> <p>Founder of <a href="http://www.hashtaghappyperiod.org/">HappyPeriod</a> Chelsea VonChaz believes that the best way to increase awareness of period poverty and menstrual inequity is for people who menstruate to start feeling more comfortable talking about their periods.</p> <p>“The main social factor is that the people, folks who are not assigned female at birth that have never had a period and will never have a period just don’t understand menstruation and they’re just ignorant and very comfortable in their ignorance and within that, choose to make it harder for folks that have a period and there’s no space for [the ignorant] to learn,” said VonChaz.</p> <p><strong>Race and Culture</strong></p> <p>Strausfeld and VonChaz touch on a topic that has seemed almost taboo. What about culture, race and ethnicity? Yes, those influence our conversation, too.</p> <iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/8074655/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" class="flourish-embed-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:600px;" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe> <div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/8074655/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/8074655" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;" /> </a></div> <p>As the map shows, the four states that tax the most (up to 2 dollars) stayed very near the median percent of the people who identify as white in a population (77 per cent).</p> <p>“When it comes to ethnicities and race, I do see more of a freedom amongst people who identify as white talking about their periods, experiencing their periods and also being more advanced when it comes to their menstrual care than folks who are non-whites,” said VonChaz.</p> <p>People are culturally more reluctant to talk openly about menstruation. “But that is changing due to youth activists who are open and loud about how natural menstruation is and what the needs are of people who menstruate,” said Strausfeld.</p> <p>In an interview with founders of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/letsperiodtalk/">Period Talk</a> Kuhu Badgi, Akshika Chawade and Niki Murthy, the three agreed that, even in the younger generations, talking about periods is vital to the de-stigmatization of menstruation. And sometimes using social media also goes a long way.</p> <p>“But we realized that it was really as simple as like making a TikTok video. Like that was something that was a really effective way to reach an audience of people and show them or just make the conversation a lot easier to talk about,” said Badgi.</p> <p>Both Strausfeld and VonChaz say that it is important for people who menstruate to help those who do not understand what menstruation is and why the need for more easily accessible period products is a pressing issue.</p> <p><strong>Health care</strong></p> <p>Although the levels of women insured changes only slightly between the states that do and don’t implement the tampon tax, there is a trend that states with no tax have a smaller percent of women who have health insurance.</p> <iframe title="Population of Women with Health Insurance" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-juGaQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/juGaQ/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1125"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p><strong>Education</strong></p> <p>An experience quite common among those who menstruate is having a period at school and not knowing what to do. Whether it is their first period, whether they completely forgot about their period, or if they just don’t have a pad, tampon, menstrual cup, etc. with them, it is always a frustrating and unnecessarily scary situation.</p> <p>It is harder for girls to gather the courage to go to the nurse’s office at school if they need a period product than if they were readily accessible in the bathrooms. But that starts with education.</p> <p>Breaking down the stigmas around periods can save a lot of young girls from trauma or embarrassment. As the struggle for public places to provide free menstrual products continues, Von Chaz says, “it takes for us to eliminate the tax, then push for politicians to make sure that period products are accessible in spaces like courthouses, shelters, transition homes, prisons, schools, libraries, etc.”</p> <iframe title="Female Educational Attainment" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-VHwj5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VHwj5/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1499"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); </script> <p>Coincidentally, the states that have higher tampon taxes are also those who tend to have a lower average percentage of women earning bachelor’s degrees.</p> <p>But part of the efforts is educating everyone, not just those who menstruate. Even as high schoolers, Badgy, Chawade and Murthy have experienced he uncomfortableness that can come from trying to explain the issue with people who don’t menstruate, especially in the older generations. Talking about the pitch competitions that launched Period Talk, Chawade said, “so [the judges] were unable to truly grasp the gravity of the problem we were trying to tackle… It was just very hard to like explain the problem to somebody who has like zero experience with menstruation.”</p> <p>So, yes. Period poverty is a real thing. Having outrageously high prices on menstrual products and charging an extra tax on them does affect the poverty rate amongst females.</p> <p>It’s only a matter of building up confidence and community by raising awareness, one period at a time.
